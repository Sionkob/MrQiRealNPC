	//Introduction
	"Qi.MrQiAndClubIntroduction": "Well, I knew you'd get to this place someday.#$b#From now on, you are part of my club, {{NameOrKid}}. Come whenever you want to spend some time.#$e#Just be careful not to get addicted to those gambling games. I don't want to deal with that kind of problem.#$b#Dealing with Welwick's alcoholism is enough.$u",

	//Spring
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_1": "A new year just started, surely this means something to you, right?#$b#For me, this means that the work is just beginning. I have a lot of things to do.#$b#So, if you'll excuse me...",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_12": "I know that tomorrow the villagers of the Valley will have a celebration called \"Egg Festival\".#$b#I wonder why they celebrate this; there is no special date on this day.#$b#Even so, each people has their own culture. I cannot judge them for that.#$e#Don't expect me to be there, and if I am, you'll have to struggle to find me in the crowd!",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_23": "Tomorrow will be a busy day for the villagers, especially the single ones.#$b#The Flower Dance festival is one of those festivals where people humble themselves to be part of the tradition.#$b#I hope you already have a dance partner, {{NameOrKid}}. And if you don't have one, don't bother people by asking if they want to dance with you; it's humiliating and embarrassing.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_28": "Summer is coming; the heat wave will be great at this time of the year.#$b#So, if you want, you can come to the club and enjoy the air-conditioned environment.#$b#And who knows, maybe you can have some fun playing games and earn some money?",

	//Summer
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_1": "I hope you've prepared your farm for this new season. Some crops are quite profitable this time of year.#$b#I can give you some tips on that if you want.#$b#Anyway, have a nice summer, {{NameOrKid}}.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_10": "Tomorrow will be Luau day; the villagers gather their best ingredients to make a soup for the governor to try...#$b#The governor trusts people so much... Someone could easily poison the soup; it's a little dangerous.#$b#I would never taste that soup for reasons of hygiene.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_27": "The migration of the Moonlight Jellies is quite a spectacle for the villagers, but not for me.#$b#Those invertebrates are very simple creatures. They just follow their instinct and swim around; there is nothing amazing about them.#$b#But it seems that bioluminescence leaves the villagers in awe. They find something as simple as lights to be a beautiful spectacle.#$b#Their attention is focused only on the light emitted. They are like moths being attracted to a lamp.",

	//Fall
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_1": "Well... What to say about autumn? It's a time of transition between summer and winter; it's the season when the leaves fall to the ground.#$b#But there are places where the differences between these seasons are not so noticeable. In tropical places, there is little difference between the seasons; they can be easily confused.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_15": "Ah... the Stardew Valley Fair, what a silly and insignificant festivity.#$b#It seems that people don't make the minimum effort to achieve excellence. They always bring mediocre products and expect to get high points for doing the minimum expected of them.$u#$b#Even the champion has weak products with little value. They may even be varied, but there's no point in having a great variety of products if they are ordinary.#$b#This is the fault of the appraiser, who is not judicious enough. I'm sure that if he were stricter, the fair's participants would put in much more effort to reach first place.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_26": "Spirit's Eve is a good festival; it has interesting things to see.#$b#That man from the Adventurers Guild always brings some monsters to the exhibition. It's not that hard to do, but it's a risk that the villagers usually don't want to take.",

	//Winter
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_1": "Winter is a good time to relax, as you don't have to tend to crops.#$b#But it is also a time when you can focus on other activities. You can fish, mine, and forage.#$b#But if you don't want to do any of that, come spend some time in the casino.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_7": "The Festival of Ice is so... boring.#$b#Some people make ice sculptures, and some make snowmen. It's such a monotonous thing; there's nothing interesting about it.#$b#But I know there's a fishing competition, so I hope you have good fishing skills if you decide to participate.#$e#You must have some skill in this, right? Never enter a competition if you're not going to win.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_17": "Today is the last day of the Night Market; there are many interesting things that those merchants sell. Things that interest me.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_24": "Hello, {{NameOrKid}}. Tomorrow will be the Winter Star Festival; the villagers will do the traditional gift exchange among themselves.#$b#Do you already know what to give your secret friend?",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_26": "Hey @, the day I told you the truth about me, you said you were scared of me...$s#$b#So I wanted to ask you something...",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_28": "Today I'm going to be away from the casino for a while. It's very tiring to deal with the people there...",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed2": "Here's a tip for when you go mining: Always take food with you when you enter the mines.#$b#Food can help you recover energy so you can spend more time mining.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu2": "Have you heard of the Prismatic Shard?#$b#It's a stone that has an extremely colorful shine. Nobody knows for sure its origin; it's very rare to be found.#$b#I remember the first time I saw one. Its glow was so beautiful; it was impressive. I even thought it was radioactive given all the brightness, but it's not.#$b#Maybe someday you'll find one. Here's a tip: You're more likely to find one in the deep levels of the Skull Cavern.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri2": "You know that guy selling the Statue of Endless Fortune for 1 million gold?#$b#It is a very useful statue to have in your home, as well as being a great decorative piece.#$b#But it's not the only useful statue you can get, there are other statues even more useful than it.#$e#What are they? Keep exploring this world and you will soon find out, {{NameOrKid}}.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat2": "How's your weekend going so far, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#Whenever you're bored, you can come to the casino and spend some time playing CalicoJack or testing your luck on the slot machines.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun2": "Welwick said she wouldn't drink too much today. Knowing her, I know she won't be able to control herself...$u#$b#She needs help to overcome her drinking problem, but there's not much you can do when someone doesn't want to be helped.$u",

	//Days Of Week - 4 Hearts (As Non-Romanceable Option)
	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon4": "Hi, {{NameOrKid}}. I hope you're having a good day.#$b#Whenever you want to spend some time, come and have fun at the casino.#$e#If you find anyone cheating, please let me know. I will take care of it.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue4": "The salesperson downstairs is Sandy. She's part of my select group of 'friends' in the valley.#$b#Well, friends in quotes, since we've never exchanged more than five words since we met. She only sees me on the day she gets her paycheck.#$b#She doesn't know much about me, and I hope she never does.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed4": "Are you practicing your other skills besides harvesting, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#If you want to achieve excellence, you have to be good at all your skills. As they say: Practice makes perfect.#$b#Life is only fun when we practice something different and challenge ourselves to always overcome our barriers; we shouldn't accept becoming stagnant in one place.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu4": "Sandy always asks to come into the casino, but I don't allow her in here, even though I know her and know she can keep it a secret.#$b#I don't think she's the kind of person who can hang out in a casino... She could cause problems with that personality of hers.$u#$b#It takes a certain responsibility to enter a casino; otherwise you can... Well, get addicted.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri4": "Have you ever bought anything with the Qi coins you earn in the casino games? You can buy many rare and useful items with them.#$b#That guy next to the hallway leading to my room sells some interesting items. You should take a look; maybe there is something of interest to you.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat4": "There are many languages in the world; each one has its own particularities. Some are more difficult to learn than others.#$b#One language that is more difficult to learn is the Dwarvish language. It takes a lot of study and interaction with dwarves to learn this language.#$e#Op ah taitsu, E om hniun e nhes noliolu, os yunn os mool adoot noliolus.

	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat4.HasDwarvishGuide": "There are many languages in the world; each one has its own particularities. Some are more difficult to learn than others.#$b#One language that is more difficult to learn is the Dwarvish language. It takes a lot of study and interaction with dwarves to learn this language.#$e#And of course, I am fluent in this language, as well as many other languages. I am fluent in any language you can imagine.#$b#Oh, did you understand what I said? Congratulations, it means you are exploring this world and discovering new things.

I hate friendship for gain.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed6": "You've already seen a Junimo, right?#$b#They are mysterious spirits who live hidden in the woods, and their mission is to protect these places from possible dangers.#$b#They are harmless to humans and can even be used for your own benefit. You can build a Junimo Hut on your farm, and they'll harvest your crops for you.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu6": "It seems like you come to the desert often, don't you, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#I hope you're using a warp totem instead of having to spend 500 gold on every trip.#$e#Have you seen those strange statues that stand in some places in the valley? They are warp points.

	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri6": "Hey, {{NameOrKid}}, I'm doing some experiments and I need someone to test them out.

I never risk people's lives in my experiments, let alone yours.#$b#You need to be healthy to be able to work on your farm, don't you?",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat6": "Can I tell you something, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#Those things in my room are purely decorative; it's just to not leave so much empty space, you know?#$b#I don't use them very often; I can't even remember the last time I turned on that sound system. It's too loud, and I hate noisy things.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun6": "For some people, Sundays are boring, but not for me.#$b#Sundays are days to try something new.#$b#Why not spend some time playing in the casino when you get off work? You deserve a break after working on your farm all day.",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue8": "%Mister Qi looks a little tired.#$e#Oh, I'm sorry, @. Last night I had to talk to an ancestor using my spiritual representation. It's a bit tiring to do this at night because I need to concentrate to maintain communication.#$b#The spiritual representation needs me to be conscious so that it has the ability to reply to other beings in the spiritual world, so I was awake longer than I should have been.#$e#Who was the ancestor? Well, it was one of the first Misters Qi who existed. He was worried that I was 'revealing too many secrets'.#$b#I understand his concern, but I managed to reassure him, so I think the time I stayed awake was worth it.",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu8": "I have to admit that when I opened this casino, I felt a little bad about winning from other people's losses. I make a lot of money from gamblers' losses and the purchase of Qi Coins.#$b#I really didn't like the idea of running a casino here; I'd feel guilty if someone lost everything gambling.#$b#That's why I try to keep this environment free of cheaters, so that every game is as balanced as possible and I don't have to make money that came from an unfair match.#$e#Although I don't think making money in this way is very ethical, unfortunately, it's the way I've found to support myself and the Oasis since the bus broke down.#$b#Or rather, was scrapped by Mayor Lewis. He simply left that bus abandoned, and when it broke down, nobody bothered to fix it until you arrived.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri8": "I see you're doing a good job on your farm, @.#$b#Does it have something to do with you knowing what your grandfather expected of you?#$b#In any case, it's great that you're taking care of your farm. Keep it up and you'll reach perfection faster than you think.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat8": "Hey, @, do you remember the day you reached level 100 of the Skull Cave and found me there?#$b#The one who was talking to you inside and offering you the Iridium Snake Milk was my semi-physical representation. That's why right after you left the cave, I was already at the entrance.#$b#When I decided to do that, I had to be sure that you wouldn't tell anyone what you had seen. That's why I was there at the cave entrance waiting for you.#$b#I can't let just anyone know these details about me; it's too dangerous. The power of the Misters Qi can easily be used for malicious purposes, so I'm cautious about who I tell about my powers.",

How are you?#$b#I was thinking about leaving the casino for a while today, but there's not much to do here; at most, I can talk to Sandy.#$b#Despite being somewhat energetic, Sandy is a good friend.

It would have been a big mistake.$s",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue10-Before10HeartsEvent": "Hey @, did you know I'm good at cooking?$h#$b#Yes, I learned to cook thanks to an ancestor who was a chef. The food preparation knowledge he had was passed on to me.#$b#Do you think I made Qi Seasoning by accident? Not at all! I wanted to use this skill I'd acquired to create amazing things.#$b#It's a shame that Qi Seasoning is radioactive... it's not so safe to consume because of that.$s#$b#You can use it in small quantities, as the amount of radiation emitted by the seasoning is reduced by almost 70 percent when compared to the radiation that Stardrop emits when consumed, but it's still there.#$e#If you ever want to taste it, you can come to my room and ask me to prepare something for you.#$b#I won't be using Qi Seasoning, of course.$h",

But I always noticed that there was something different about me; I knew things that other people my age wouldn't know.#$b#Many people considered me a prodigy. They asked me how I knew so many things, and I simply couldn't explain it; I just... knew.#$e#I only realized that I was one of the Misters Qi in my early teens. That's when I understood why I knew many things that other people didn't; it was the knowledge of previous Misters Qi that was passed on to me.#$b#I started to listen more carefully to the voices in my head; they were the previous Misters Qi. They explained to me that I was a Mister Qi and told me about my responsibility in the world.#$b#I had a huge responsibility on my hands when I was still a teenager, so I decided to put my ordinary life aside and listen to the advice of past Misters Qi.#$e#It was because of them that I moved to Ginger Island.

I wrote the text for him, and we put the letter in the guy's notebook and waited for the next class to start.#$b#I remember that when the guy saw the letter and started reading, the first thing he did was look at me because he realized it was my handwriting.

	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun10-Before10HeartsEvent": "Hey @, one of the biggest mistakes a Mister Qi can make is to overestimate their own power.#$b#This error can be fatal, and it's a bit scary to know that many Misters Qi have died because of it.#$b#When a mortal being has too much power in their hands, they tend to think they can do more than they actually can, and in the case of the Misters Qi, this can mean a death sentence.$u#$e#The first Mister Qi in history died too soon because he thought he was a god. He was worshipped by his people and used his powers to fulfill their wishes.#$b#One day, his community was facing a severe drought, which was killing their crops and animals; hunger was spreading through the community, and Mister Qi promised that he would bring heavy rains in the coming days.#$b#We cannot control the weather, and as the days passed and the rain didn't come, the community thought that Mister Qi wanted them to starve.#$b#So, in an act of rebellion, they killed him, and... well, I think it's pretty obvious what they did next.#$b#Of course, he was the first Mister Qi to exist, so he had no idea what he could and couldn't do, but his story served as a lesson for the next Misters Qi.",

	//Days Of Week - 2 Hearts (As Romanceable Option)
	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon2-RomanceableQi": "Hey @, my room has a much lighter atmosphere now that you've helped me get rid of Mona's clothes.$h#$b#Knowing that those clothes were still there made the experience of being in that place extremely terrible; it was as if I went back to the day of the accident every time I entered.#$b#But now my room seems much calmer and more peaceful to me, as it should be. I think that although what we did was a small gesture, it already made a big difference.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue2-RomanceableQi": "I hope you don't mind this, but I'm still watching you to guide you to perfection, @.#$b#I must keep the promise I made to your grandfather; he was someone important and he trusted me with this mission, so I'll keep my word.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed2-RomanceableQi": "It seems that Sandy is suspicious that something might be going on between us; she's sharp when it comes to these things...$u#$b#I've been trying to tell her that there's nothing going on, but obviously she doesn't believe me.$u#$b#I'm doing this because I'm not ready for it yet... I need to get over Mona first so that we can have something more, and I hope I can do it with your help, @.$u#$e#So can you tell Sandy that there's nothing going on between us, just so she can stop bothering me?$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu2-RomanceableQi": "I've been leaving the casino and going to Pelican Town occasionally, but I don't have much to do there.#$b#I'm even getting criticism from some past Misters Qi. They don't like the idea of us being exposed to the world and interacting with other people, and they're right; it can be dangerous.#$b#But the people in the valley have no idea what I am. They think I'm just a rich guy who takes care of some business.#$b#I did the same thing when I moved to the desert, and nothing happened. Why would something happen now?#$b#And even if I don't have much to do there, at least I'll be a little more accessible if you need anything or just want to talk.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri2-RomanceableQi": "Your grandfather had higher expectations of you than just achieving perfection; he left something very special for you somewhere in the valley.#$b#I can't tell you more than that. It's something you'll have to discover on your own, but I imagine you'll find out what I'm talking about soon enough.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat2-RomanceableQi": "Hi @, how are you? I was in my lab just now, taking a look at that Stardrop. It looked strange, stranger than usual.#$b#It was giving off a sweet aroma; it's not normal for a Stardrop to give off odors when it rots.#$b#I had to isolate it to study it better; it could be some kind of mutation. If I have any news, I'll let you know.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun2-RomanceableQi": "I'll try to go to the Saloon tonight; I should get along with the locals. Some don't know me, and I feel like I'm intimidating to them.#$b#You should go there too if you have time, @.",

	//Days Of Week - 4 Hearts (As Romanceable Option)
	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon4-RomanceableQi": "Good morning @, how are you? Are you well? That's great!$h#$b#Ah, I've been reading Mona's diary entries lately. I've finally got the courage to read them. They're quite long; she really liked to write things in great detail.#$b#Sometimes, too much detail...$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue4-RomanceableQi": "Going to Pelican Town occasionally has been a good way to relax. It's nice to talk to the friends I have there.#$b#I still don't know how I thought isolating myself from everyone and focusing on the casino would be a good idea. It was the worst thing I could have done at a time like that.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_Wed4-RomanceableQi": "Today I'm meeting a friend, Linus. He's a fan of a very simple lifestyle; I think you might already know him.#$b#How did I meet him? Well, let's just say he's part of the network of another friend of mine.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu4-RomanceableQi": "Sandy still asks me to enter the club, but I don't know if I should allow it... Do you think it's a good idea?$s#$e#Okay, maybe I should let her in here sometime. But if she overdoes it, I'll put limits on her.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri4-RomanceableQi": "Hi @, have a nice weekend. Today I'm going to spend some time in Pelican Town. I want to stay a little further away from the casino.#$b#I plan to stop by the Saloon later. Stop by if you can, too, @.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat4-RomanceableQi": "Talking to my representations at night has helped me a lot to control their personalities. But at the same time, it makes me a little tired.#$b#My physical body may have had a good night's sleep, but I had to stay awake mentally for several hours to talk to the representations.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun4-RomanceableQi": "I'll try to go to the Saloon again tonight, but at the moment, I want to be alone for a while. I want to take some time to organize my thoughts. I hope you understand.#$b#No, I'm not feeling bad or anything; it's just that it's been hard to find time for myself lately. I need more time talking to my representations. Don't worry.",

	//Days Of Week - 6 Hearts (As Romanceable Option)
	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon6-RomanceableQi": "Visiting Pelican Town again has drastically reduced the amount of energy my extra-physical representation requires, which is great.#$b#Now I don't have to watch them one by one twenty-four hours a day. I can simply talk to the villagers in person, and that already gives me a good sense of what I need to do.#$b#This makes me less tired, since extra-physical representation needs a lot of energy to stay active, even more than the semi-physical one. The less I need it, the better for me.$h#$e#Ever since I discovered the representations, I've had to manage which one I should use. Otherwise, my physical body weakens.#$b#This wasn't a problem before I moved to the valley, but at the same time, I had a dull life. So I think this energy juggling is worth it.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue6-RomanceableQi": "Have you found any of the mysterious boxes I've scattered around the world? You can get various items if you take them to the town's blacksmith.#$b#I scattered these boxes so that you could find them. It's part of the promise I made to your grandfather.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu6-RomanceableQi": "Hi @. Today I'll be very busy with my experiments in the lab. {{AlienName}} needs more attention, now that he's in ideal conditions.#$b#There's no telling how fast he might develop. What if he develops so fast that he ends up escaping from the capsule? That's not a risk I want to take.#$b#Feel free to come by my lab and help me. It was really fun having your help last time.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri6-RomanceableQi": "I'm going to let Sandy into the casino today. She's been asking me to join the club for a long time.#$b#Today I'll give her a chance; I hope I don't regret it. I might have to skip going to the Saloon tonight.$s",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat6-RomanceableQi": "You know, @, although I know a lot of people, I don't consider all of them friends. I can literally count on one hand the people I consider friends: you and the Wizard.#$b#You two are the only ones I consider true friends, the only ones who know about my powers and that I don't need to hide secrets.#$b#For a human, having only two friends might seem little, but for a Mister Qi, it's a lot. Misters Qi have always been loners.#$b#I'm the first to change that, and future Misters Qi will benefit from it as well.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_Sun6-RomanceableQi": "Hi @, how are you? I'm doing great today. It's a beautiful day.#$b#I woke up in a good mood today. Why? Well, in the coming days, solar activity will increase and solar storms may hit the Earth.#$b#During this period, luminous spectacles can appear in the sky: the polar auroras.#$b#I'm fascinated by polar auroras; whenever there's an increase in solar activity, I keep an eye on the planet's poles to watch them. It's a wonderful light show to see.$h#$e#Unfortunately, I've never been able to witness a polar aurora physically. I've always observed them with the extra-physical representation. I hope to see one physically someday.",

	//Days Of Week - 8 Hearts (As Romanceable Option)
	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon8-RomanceableQi": "Hi @, how are you? Are you okay? That's great!$h#$b#I've been feeling very different lately; I feel that a lot has changed in me. Thanks to your help, I feel lighter.#$e#I was trying to ignore the past, but now I'm trying to see it in a different way.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue8-RomanceableQi": "Hey, I was thinking of trying to swim at the beach again someday... but just thinking about it doesn't make me feel good. It's a shame; I really wanted to try, but it still seems too hard.$s#$b#Maybe I should try going slower? Perhaps swim in the river in Stardew Valley or the desert lagoons...#$b#Although the water in the desert lagoons is too hot... yeah, the river is the only option.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu8-RomanceableQi": "Lewis and I don't have a very good relationship. I don't agree with the way he runs the town.#$b#Mona didn't agree either; she even suggested the idea of me running for mayor of Pelican Town, but I couldn't.#$b#I was too young for that, and I wasn't born in the Ferngill Republic to hold any position here. But even if I could, I wouldn't do it.#$b#I already have too many responsibilities; I don't need another one. Besides, the history of the Misters Qi shows that we're not meant to lead.#$b#We should always stay behind the scenes; it's safer.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri8-RomanceableQi": "I hope you don't think it's strange that I still want to keep Mona's memory with me.$s#$b#I understand it might seem as if I want you to replace her, but I swear that's not it, @.$u#$b#I just want her story to be passed on to future Misters Qi and for her to be remembered as a milestone for us, because she truly was.#$b#If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here talking to you. But I understand if you don't feel comfortable and don't want to continue with this; that's your choice.#$b#But I appreciate your help. I could never have done that on my own.$h#$e#I'm sorry I said that so suddenly, but I felt I needed to make my intentions clear.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat8-RomanceableQi": "Hi @, today I'm going to analyze {{AlienName}}'s growth. You can come and help me if you want.#$b#It's good for {{AlienName}} to get used to you too, since you'll be entering that lab quite often now.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun8-RomanceableQi": "You know Leo? I saw the day his parents got stranded on Ginger Island, a few years after Mona's death.#$b#They were in a terrible situation, and to make things worse, his mother went into labor.#$b#Unfortunately, seeking something to help her, Leo's father fell into the ocean trying to climb a palm tree to collect leaves, and his mother didn't survive the birth.$s#$b#I had to use my Semi-Physical Representation to save him, and I had to return there occasionally to take care of him. If it weren't for me, that boy wouldn't have survived.#$b#He'd always been friends with the parrots on the island. When I noticed that, I made him understand the birds' language using my powers.#$b#He thinks the parrots have always taken care of him because he has no memory of me.#$b#And I think it's best to keep it that way; it might be too much for him to find out now.",

Try to beat her.",

	//Flower Dance
	"FestivalDialogue.Qi.spring24": "This festival is really silly, but I understand the appeal it has.#$b#I hope you already have a partner to dance with, {{NameOrKid}}. Getting several \"no's\" in a row is humiliating.",
	"FestivalDialogue.Qi.spring24-DanceAccept": "Oh, you want to dance with me? Okay, I guess I can try. I shouldn't, but I think once won't be bad.#$b#... The color of the suit is the same as my skin color; it's going to be so weird... Can I wear gloves?$s",
	"FestivalDialogue.Qi.spring24-DanceAccept_Spouse": "Of course, I'd love to dance with you, honey!$h",
	"FestivalDialogue.Qi.spring24-DanceDecline": "Thanks, but I'll pass. I don't want to dance. It's better not to get involved in village culture. I hope you understand.",

	//Luau
	"FestivalDialogue.Qi.summer11": "This festival is really crowded. It's not a problem; it's just that it's a lot harder to find a place with fewer people around.#$b#I need to remain unnoticed by others.#$e#At least here it's a little further away from all the partying.",

	//Dance of the Moonlight Jellies

Only weak products and no variety.",

	//Spirit's Eve
	"FestivalDialogue.Qi.fall27": "This maze is too easy. Rasmodius could do something harder, something different...#$e#Feel free to take the prize, it's not important to me. I'm only here because it's a more isolated place.",

	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Tue": "The position I am in is hard to reach; it took a lot of struggle to achieve what I have.#$b#Effort and willpower are the only things that take us forward.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Wed": "Wherever you go, I'll always be behind the scenes, making sure everything is going according to plan.#$b#I am everywhere; at the same time.#$b#Or am I just trying to scare you? Good luck trying to find out, hahaha.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Thu": "I'm surprised at you, {{NameOrKid}}.#$b#Looking for the golden walnuts is hard work and a bit tedious, but you keep looking for them. That's very good.#$b#That shows that you don't like leaving thing half done. When you start a task, you strive to finish it.#$b#It's quite a quality; some people would have stopped looking for the nuts before they even found me.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Fri": "When you achieve your goals, look for others. And when you reach them, look for others and others. Keep doing this until your days in this world are over.",

	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Tue-SeenQi8heartsEvent": "Now that you know the truth about me and the other representations, I feel lighter.#$b#Now I cause less overload on the mind of the main representation, and that's very good.$h#$b#Since I had a slightly different behavior from the other representations, the main representation's mind had to work harder to deal with two behavioral patterns and direct them to the right representations, which was exhausting.#$b#Now that you know about my power, I have a personality more like that of the main representation, since there's no longer any reason to split my personality in two.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Wed-SeenQi8heartsEvent": "Hi @, have you checked out the volcano cave?#$b#You can find lots of ores that you can't find in ordinary caves.#$e#Just be careful with the monsters; they're a bit stronger than the ones in ordinary caves, so use a good weapon when going in there.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Thu-SeenQi8heartsEvent": "This island has several secrets spread around. Maybe it's worth exploring this island more deeply; you might find some interesting things, @.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Fri-SeenQi8heartsEvent": "Before I moved to the Calico Desert, I lived here, on Ginger Island.#$b#I lived here because it was a nearly isolated place, and since I hadn't yet discovered the power of Consciousness Bifurcation, I needed to take on all the responsibilities of a Mister Qi using the main representation.#$b#So I decided to focus on my responsibilities as Mister Qi and put my social life aside. That's when I came here and built the walnut room, which used to be my bedroom.#$e#But... there came a time when I... I got tired of isolating myself so much from the world.$s#$b#So I decided to restart my social life by going to live in the Calico Desert. It was a bit awkward at first, mainly because I had just discovered Consciousness Bifurcation and was still getting used to dealing with the representations.#$b#But despite all that... It was really worth it.$h",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Sat-SeenQi8heartsEvent": "Hey @, remember that even if you now know that your grandfather expects you to reach perfection, you don't need to rush to achieve it. You can take as long as you want to get there.#$b#Especially since your grandfather also wanted you to make the most of your new life in Stardew Valley. Perfection is just one step, not the entire journey.#$e#No matter how long it takes, we'll be happy when you achieve perfection.$h",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Sun-SeenQi8heartsEvent": "I've put a perfection meter on the right to let you know how close to perfection you are.#$b#You should take a look so you know what's missing to reach it.",

	//After seeing Mr. Qi 4 Hearts Events in Romance Route
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Tue-RomanceableQi": "I acted in a very cruel way towards the main representation the day you came here.$s#$b#As a Mister Qi, I used to think that to get over an event that causes you suffering, you should forget everything. But now I understand that I was wrong.#$b#There are things that should be remembered fondly.$h#$e#But I still think that swimsuit is horrible.$u",

	"Qi.MovieReactions.fall_movie_0.AfterMovie": "I really liked \"Mysterium\", it seems very experimental. It's not like an ordinary horror movie. They really managed to capture the evil essence of those creatures and put it on screen.#$b#Only the ending doesn't make any sense; they took advantage of the shadow people's appearance to create a terrifying air. Not all of them are the way they were portrayed.",

	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_1": "Fall 15 ^^ Today was a stressful day. This college is going to drive me crazy. I can't pay much attention in class because I arrive at college tired from my work. I need to hand in a lot of assignments, and I still need to think about the topic for my thesis. I feel like I'm running around like a headless chicken. Sometimes I wonder if all of this will be worth it. ^^ And I still have to deal with Ricky; he's getting more and more annoying. I really don't know what to do anymore. A few hours ago, he came to my house for dinner, even though I told him not to. He just said, \"Deal with it,\" and came over, then sat on the sofa waiting! Seriously, he's so lazy. ^^ When I look back, I think about how stupid I was to fall in love with him. But at the same time, how could I have known that he would become a different person after only two seasons? How could I have known that the loving, understanding, and kind person would turn into someone rude, lazy, and selfish? He doesn't care about my problems; they mean nothing to him.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_2": "Fall 18 ^^ This week has been very difficult. I have a college assignment I need to do, but I can't concentrate anymore. There's so much happening here. Ali told me that my rent will increase next season because a shopping mall is opening nearby. I'm already struggling to pay the rent currently; imagine when it increases? I'm afraid I'll run out of money at the end of the season. I'll try to talk to my boss and see if he can give me a raise. ^^ And Ricky is becoming more and more unbearable. Just yesterday, we had another fight; he was accusing me of not paying attention to him and his problems. How can I do that for him if he doesn't do the same for me? And honestly, what kind of problems could this idiot be going through? Ricky is extremely spoiled; anything that happens, he has his mom fix it. If he expects me to do the same, he can keep waiting. ^^ I don't know how I put up with this guy for two seasons. I think it's time to end this, but I have a lot of other things to do. So for now, I'll leave him in his place and deal with more important things; he doesn't deserve that much attention anyway.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_3": "Fall 26 ^^ Today we were informed that classes for this semester will end next Friday. I was relieved to hear that; it's one less thing to deal with. But despite the relief, I still have to worry about finding a topic for my thesis since next semester is my last, and it's good to have some idea of what to write in advance. But how will I have time to think about this? I have a lot of other problems to solve: there's the rent issue, my raise proposal that was rejected, and I still have to deal with Ricky. My life is full of setbacks, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile my studies with my personal life. ^^ Today, Ricky came here again. This time he was apologizing for what he'd been doing these past few days. He seemed to be sincere, but as soon as I told him about my rent, he went back to being a jerk, refusing to help me and saying, \"You've always managed to get by; why now do you want my help?\" Give me patience, because I don't have any left! ^^ I'm exhausted by all this; Ricky's behavior only stresses me out and distracts me. I need to put an end to this as soon as possible. Maybe then I'll be able to concentrate on my studies. ^^ But I must admit, in Ricky's words, there was some truth: I have always solved these kind of problems on my own. So why did I ask Ricky to help me pay the rent? I really don't know; probably out of desperation.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_4": "Winter 5 ^^ Finally, the semester is over, now I'm on vacation. But being on vacation doesn't mean my work is over; I still have some other issues to resolve. Today, I spoke to Ricky and told him I wanted to break up. And, as expected, he didn't take the breakup very well. He shouted at me and tried to convince me to change my mind, but I'd been determined to break up with him for a while; I just needed to solve my other problems to do it. Knowing that Ricky is out of my life is a relief. ^^ He tried to threaten me, saying that I was making a big mistake, that he wouldn't let me leave his life, that I would regret what I did, and stuff like that; just nonsense. Ricky would never do that kind of thing; he's too lazy to try anything against me. He just tried to scare me so I wouldn't break up. He'll probably just be sad for a few seasons and then try to find another sucker to deceive. ^^ I hope the next unlucky girl realizes the trap before I do.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_5": "Winter 7 ^^ Ricky is crazy! I thought he wouldn't try to do anything against me, but I was wrong. He DEFINITELY can. ^^ Yesterday, he sent me some strange letters threatening me, and in these letters he also sent some photos of me in moments of my routine. I wasn't expecting this from him; it's bizarre! But I wish it was just that. ^^ Today, on my way home from work, I took a taxi, and the driver simply ignored my destination and took me to Ricky's house. He was waiting for me and wanted to talk to me. How did he manage to bribe the taxi guy? Luckily, he didn't want to do anything to me, but it still scared me. It's one more reason to stay away from him; I made sure to file a restraining order against him. I hope this keeps me safe.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_6": "Winter 8 ^^ It seems that Ricky didn't give up so easily. He's tried to call my cell phone number several times since yesterday, but I've already changed my number, so I hope he doesn't find out this new one. But, not satisfied with not being able to call me on my cell phone, now he won't stop calling me on the landline at home. He's going to drive me crazy. If this house weren't rented, I would have smashed that phone on the first call. ^^ And as if that wasn't enough, he found a way to stalk me even with the restraining order: he asks his friends to keep an eye on me. I only found out because, during my break at work, I overheard Ian talking to him about me on the phone. I'm not safe even at work. ^^ I talked about everything that happened with my best friend, Dalia. She was scared when she heard everything Ricky was doing; she said she didn't expect him to do something like this. I think it surprised everyone. ^^ She and her husband also offered to help me. They allowed me to stay at their house until we decide what we're going to do. I'm very grateful to them for letting me stay here; I wouldn't be able to sleep peacefully at home.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_7": "Winter 10 ^^ Being in this city is no longer safe for me. Ricky is stalking me everywhere; he's already found out that I'm living in Dalia's house. Luckily, he can't get in here because of the security guards, but I can't stay here forever. Dalia's husband told me that it would be better if I moved out, so I could start my life again in a new place, away from Ricky. If I'd heard this three days ago, I'd have thought it was an exaggeration, but now I see that it's necessary. He won't leave me alone while I'm here, so I've agreed to move. ^^ Dalia told me about a place that would be perfect for me to start again: Stardew Valley, in the Ferngill Republic. She said it's an isolated region on the other side of the Gem Sea. It sounds like a perfect place for someone who wants to start over, so I decided to move there. Dalia's husband said that he has contact with someone there and will arrange a small apartment for me so that I can arrive in Stardew Valley with a place to live. ^^ However, before I leave, I need to sort out some paperwork at my college. I need to change the mode of my course to a correspondence course, so I can continue my studies even from afar. Luckily, Dalia's husband requested that I be accompanied by security guards while I'm in the city, so at least I can resolve this issue without worrying that someone is watching me. I just hope I can solve this problem quickly.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_8": "Winter 12 ^^ Finally, it's official. I'm now studying by correspondence. Now I can focus on my move to Stardew Valley. Taking advantage of the fact that I was accompanied by security guards, I decided to go into my house again to get the things I had left behind. That house reminded me of the day I moved there... It seemed super quiet, and the neighborhood was very welcoming. The neighbors prepared a small welcome party for me! I met so many friends that day... I hope I also meet some nice people there in Stardew Valley. ^^ I also went to my work to resign, and there was Ian. Before I left, he asked me why I had resigned, as if being watched by a coworker wasn't a good reason to resign. He also asked why I was cheating on Ricky. I was very confused, but then I understood: Ricky told his friends that I was cheating on him and asked them to watch me. Honestly, this surprised me; it's not like him. ^^ Anyway, I told Ian the truth, and he was shocked to hear the whole story and apologized. Ricky had made his friends believe I was a horrible person. He said that Ricky will pay dearly for his lies. I'm not sure how that will happen, but I know he deserves it.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_9": "Winter 14 ^^ Today is the day. The day I'm finally going to Stardew Valley. I thought this day would never come; this week has taken so long to pass. ^^ I'm very anxious, but I hope that this move will bring me the peace I've been looking for, and that I can focus on what really matters.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_10": "Winter 15 ^^ I've just arrived in the Stardew Valley, in a small village called Pelican Town. It was a long journey, and I'm quite tired, but the feeling of calm and tranquillity I felt as soon as I arrived in Pelican Town was so good. Even the air here seems lighter. ^^ However, before I arrived here, at Gotoro Empire Airport, Ricky discovered my phone number again; he doesn't give up. I had to change it again when I passed through a town near here called Zuzu City. I didn't have time to see if there's cell phone signal in Pelican Town, but I hope there is. I want to see that scoundrel Ricky discover this number now. ^^ The apartment that Dalia's husband has rented for me is very cozy, and I've heard that he's already paid for two seasons in advance for me, which is great. I'll have enough time to get a job and support myself.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_11": "Winter 16 ^^ My first day in Pelican Town was much busier than I expected. Early in the morning, while taking a walk to get to know the town better, I met an elderly woman tending to some flower beds in the village; it was Evelyn. She's a very nice person; she even reminds me a bit of my mother with her caring nature. She invited me to her house to try some cookies, and they were delicious! I also met her husband, George. He seems a bit grumpy, but I could see in his eyes how much he loves Evelyn. Evelyn wanted me to stay to meet her grandson, Alex, but I preferred to leave and continue exploring the village. ^^ While I was walking around the village, I went into a place called \"Pierre's General Store\" to see what it was about. It's a small market, and the owner is Pierre, who I found out was the \"contact\" that Dalia's husband had here in Stardew Valley. Pierre told me that he is a friend of Dalia's husband and that he was the one who found my apartment. He also said that Dalia's husband asked him to offer me a job when I arrived in the village, and that's exactly what he did: he offered me a job as a cleaning lady, with a salary of 1700 gold per month. It's a generous offer, but I can't accept an offer like that without giving it some thought first. I need time to think about the topic for my thesis; that's why I decided to move here. I need to take this into account before making a decision. ^^ Even so, I took a look at his house to see the size and amount of furniture to clean, to help me decide if it would be worth it. While I was there, I met Caroline, his wife, and Abigail, his daughter. Caroline seems nice, but Abigail wasn't very friendly with me. Her manner resembles me when I was still living with my father. I always thought that I was very independent, that I would be free to do whatever I wanted when I lived on my own, and that life would be easy. How immature I was. When I finally moved out of my father's house, reality hit me hard. It was difficult to adapt to the new reality, but I changed and matured. I hope Abigail doesn't have to go through what I went through. Anyway, their house doesn't seem very big, and there's little to clean, so it might be a good opportunity, but I'm still in doubt. I'll think more about this in the coming days. ^^ After going to Pierre's house, I went to the Pelican Town bar, the Stardrop Saloon. That place is quite lively, and I got to know the other villagers. I even met someone really nice there, Sandy. She's very outgoing; I like people like that, even though I'm more on the introverted side. She told me about a festival that was going to take place tonight in the village; it's called \"Night Market\". She said it's an annual festival where traders from various places arrive by boat and set up the docks, selling various items. She invited me to come along, and I accepted. It sounds fun. I was surprised to learn that Pelican Town is on the coast. I love going to the beach occasionally, but I couldn't go often when I lived in the Gotoro Empire. ^^ I found some interesting things for sale during the festival. I wanted to buy some paintings by the painter Lupini, but to my surprise, the sellers didn't accept my money. A saleswoman was even very rude when she saw the money in my hands. I was very confused because no one had ever refused my money until then. I think it's a good idea to go to an exchange office to change my money into the local currency, to avoid this kind of embarrassment once all the hustle and bustle of moving is over. Anyway, I had a great time at the festival with Sandy. I really think we're going to be good friends.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_12": "Winter 22 ^^ I decided to accept Pierre's offer to work as a cleaning lady at his house. His house isn't that big, and Caroline told me that I wouldn't have to go there every day since she could take care of the house herself. She said I only needed to go there on Sundays, which is fine with me. She said I would start next Sunday. ^^ It's good that Caroline can take care of that house by herself. I'll only work four days and earn 1700 gold at the end of the season. That's plenty for me; at least I won't be struggling at the end of the season. ^^ Speaking of money, I talked to Lewis, the mayor of Pelican Town, about where I could find a reliable exchange office in Zuzu City. I want to resolve this before the end of the year; I want to start the new year without any pending issues. This year has been crazy, and I just want peace in the new year. Luckily, Lewis knew one and gave me the address; I plan to go tomorrow. ^^ I've noticed that since I arrived here in Stardew Valley I haven't been bothered by Ricky anymore. No calls, no stalking, no threats... nothing. I think he's finally left me alone. I think moving to Stardew Valley was a wise choice; I should thank Dalia's husband for suggesting this place for me to move to. I'll try to call Dalia before bed. I haven't called her once since the day I got here; she must be worried. And I must also admit that I am curious about what happened to Ricky. Ian said he would pay for the things he did. I wanted to know what happened.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_13": "Winter 23 ^^ Last night, I finally called Dalia, and we talked for hours. She was very worried about me for not calling her once during the week, but she was very happy to hear that I'm okay here in Stardew Valley. I really should have called her earlier, but the move took up a lot of my time, and I kind of forgot to call her. Anyway, it was great to hear her voice. ^^ During the conversation, I asked Dalia what happened to Ricky after I left. She told me that Ricky had been reported by Ian for some crimes he had committed a few years ago. She didn't tell me in much detail; she just said that they were terrible crimes. She also said that he was reported for trying to stalk me even though I had a restraining order. She said that since Ricky had manipulated his friends into watching me, they had also been arrested. However, Ricky ran away, and no one knows where he is. I was shocked to hear all this. Ricky didn't seem like someone who would commit some kind of heinous crime, but it seems that appearances can be deceiving. At least I'm far away from him. He won't be bothering me now. I hope they find him and that he rots in jail for everything he did. ^^ But now, speaking of things here in the valley, today I went to the exchange office that Lewis recommended to me to change the Gotoro Empire money into gold. It was a bit difficult to find the place, as the exchange office had changed its name; but after asking a lot of people, I managed to find it. But when I got there, they didn't exchange Gotoro Empire money for gold. ^^ However, an attendant who also came from Gotoro Empire was very nice to me and gave me the address of a bank that could do the conversion, so I ran there before it closed. Luckily, I arrived in time. It was paperwork after paperwork, but I managed to convert my money. ^^ When I saw how much I had after converting my money to gold, I almost fell over. It was a lot of money, a LOT! I'd always heard that the Gotoro Empire's currency was highly valued, but I didn't know it was that much. Maybe I don't even need that job Pierre gave me after all. But I've already accepted it; I can't quit a job I haven't even started. ^^ Anyway, all this money is a great relief for me. I'll be able to focus on my thesis without worrying about running out of money. I'll be able to concentrate more on my studies and also get to know the people here better. And of course, thinking about the future, I've put some of this money away in the bank to use on some projects I have for after college. I'm not crazy to go out with so much money on me; I don't even have anywhere to keep it. I'm not my dad to keep money under a mattress.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_14": "Spring 15 ^^ Today was a very busy day. It was another festival day: the Desert Festival. There was a festival on Saturday, and there's another one on Monday, and it'll last until Wednesday! It seems like the people of Stardew Valley love a festival. I don't blame them; who doesn't like a day off? I heard about this festival because Sandy was talking about it for days. She really likes this festival; I think it's because she can spend the whole day with Emily. ^^ I went there after I'd finished tidying up my apartment. Doing challenges to win Calico Eggs is very fun, and betting on the races is also very cool; too bad I didn't win once. Maybe I'll try again in the next few days. ^^ But I saw something that caught my interest, something that has nothing to do with the festival. There's an unfinished construction in the desert; it looks like it would be a small building. I asked some people in the village about it, and they told me that it was supposed to be a branch of a company, but the project was canceled because the company went bankrupt, and no one was interested in the place until then. But that place caught my eye. ^^ One of my plans after finishing my studies is to get my own house, but I thought this would be a long-term plan since it would be very expensive. But now that I have a lot of money saved, I can put this plan into practice sooner than expected. I really liked the idea of living in the Calico Desert; it seems very peaceful when there aren't any festivals going on, of course. But I don't mind a bit of noise once in a while. ^^ And since the construction has been abandoned for years and no one is interested in finishing it, maybe I could finish the building and live in it. Maybe it's a crazy idea, but I've really thought about it, and I have the resources to do it, so why not? I love the idea of living in Calico Desert, but of course, I'll do some research to find out who owns the property and see if I can build my house there. That place has a lot of potential. I'd be very happy living in such a peaceful place like the Desert, not to mention that I prefer to live in a place that doesn't snow at the end of the year; I don't like snow very much. I hope everything goes well.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_15": "Spring 26 ^^ I finally made progress in finding the owner of that land where that construction is in the Calico Desert. I've spent the last few days looking for the name of who could be the owner and found one person: Adrian Summers, the son of the owner of the company that went bankrupt. The owner of the land where the company building would be is the son of the company's owner... A very questionable decision, but okay. Anyway, yesterday I got his number, and we arranged to talk at his house in the afternoon. During the conversation, I asked why he left the place abandoned. He said that the place wasn't useful to him because it was poorly located and that he always looked for someone to sell it to, but nobody wanted it. ^^ He was even willing to sell the land to me for a low price, and of course, I said I wanted to buy it; but when he realized I wanted to build a house, he wanted to raise the price. After some bargaining, we reached an agreement, and I bought the land. Now I own that construction; I can finish it and turn it into my house. ^^ I can't believe I'm going to fulfill my dream of owning my own home before I finish college. I think some junimo moved with me to Stardew Valley and is bringing me luck! Leaving the Gotoro Empire was the best move I've ever made. I'll definitely call Dalia to tell her the news and thank her husband for suggesting that I move to the valley. ^^ When I got back, I told Sandy about my plans. She was very happy, but she said that she also had plans for that place. She wanted to set up a store there and was saving money for it. Well, I suggested that we work together to build both my house and the store she wanted. After all, I don't need to live in a building; we could leave the store on the ground floor and my house would be on the first. Sandy loved the idea and agreed to work together to build this building so that we could both make our dreams come true.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_16": "Summer 4 ^^ Over the last few days, Sandy and I have been racking our brains to think of a building design that would please both of us. I want something simpler and less flashy; I'd like to live in a more cozy and discreet place. Sandy, on the other hand, wants a large, modern, and colorful building since, according to her, the more colorful it is, the more attention it will bring to the store. I understand her point, but if I followed her line of thinking, I'd end up living in a dollhouse. ^^ I started to think that suggesting she join me in finishing this building and making our dreams come true might not have been a good idea. We have very different opinions, and it was very difficult to find a middle ground between us. This difference of opinion led us to seek Robin's help to create a design that would please both of us, and she surprisingly succeeded. Her work turned out amazing; Sandy and I love it! ^^ While we were there, Robin asked if we had already thought of a name for the store. We hadn't decided on a name for the store yet, as we were too busy thinking about the building's appearance. But Sandy came up with a name right then: \"Oasis\". I loved the name; I think it makes perfect sense for a store in the middle of a desert to be called Oasis. Now that we have a design we like and the name of the store, the next step is to start constructing the building. I even thought about asking Robin to do the work, but she said she wasn't qualified for such a big job and that it would take her a long time to finish. However, she gave us the contact information of a friend of hers in Zuzu City who could do the job. I called him, and we arranged to meet in person in a few days to sort everything out. ^^ I look forward to seeing this project become a reality. I can't even believe that I'm fulfilling one of my biggest dreams, and I'm very happy to see Sandy's happiness at having her own store, or rather, our own store.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_17": "Summer 9 ^^ Today I met up with the friend Robin had referred to talk about the building's construction. His name is Phillip; he's an engineer. He also brought someone else with him to talk to me, an architect who coincidentally is named Ricky. When I heard his name, I felt a little uncomfortable, but I kept a friendly manner and greeted him. Shaking Ricky's hand felt as if I was handing myself over to the other Ricky, for him to do whatever he wanted with me. It wasn't a very pleasant experience, but I tried to stay calm and focus on what was most important at that moment. Ricky is in the past, and I will not allow him to affect me. Phillip and Ricky said they could help me build the building. ^^ Ricky carefully reviewed Robin's designs and praised the project a lot, but Phillip said that we needed to assess the terrain before moving forward, so the three of us went to the desert to assess the terrain. Ricky was notably surprised to see the abandoned building, and his interest in constructing my building increased. I was curious and asked Phillip the reason for Ricky's reaction. Phillip explained to me that Ricky had worked on the design of the old building, which was his first big project for a major company. Ricky had put a lot of effort into that project, as it would be one of the highlights of his professional career, but unfortunately, the company went bankrupt, the project was never completed, and to make matters worse, the building project was sold to the company, so he wouldn't be able to put that project into practice due to legal issues. ^^ Ricky's history with that building made me trust him to make any changes to the project that Robin had designed, as long as the changes were informed and approved by Sandy and me. He was very happy to know that I was trusting his ability and said that he will do the best job possible, just as he did with the old building project. And Phillip said that the terrain is perfect for the construction of the building and that, if we start as soon as possible, it will be ready in two seasons; much faster than I thought. Now, Phillip and Ricky will take care of the building's planning, and the construction will begin as soon as possible. ^^ I'm very happy that things are going smoothly, despite the ghosts of the past trying to unbalance me. I must take care of these matters before they get out of hand. I learned the cruelest way that unresolved traumas can turn you into someone unrecognizable. I'll never forget the day I saw my mother in a psychotic break and my father had to hospitalize her; it was too much for someone who had just entered adolescence. I looked at my mother and simply didn't recognize her anymore. I don't want to go through that.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_18": "Fall 20 ^^ The construction of the building is finally finished; it was much faster than I imagined. I can't believe I have my own home now, it's a true dream. But before I could finally sleep under the roof of a house I built, I had to go to Zuzu City with Sandy to buy some furniture for the house; I don't even have a bed to sleep on there. So we bought the basics for living in a new house: a bed, a fridge, a stove, and of course, a dishwasher. I've always wanted one in my house. My apartment in the Gotoro Empire had one, and it saved me a lot of time, something I'll definitely need. ^^ Of course, Sandy also made me buy furniture and equipment for the other rooms of the house. She made me buy a sound system to put in the living room and a sofa. I'm glad she reminded me about the sofa; I swear if it weren't for her, I'd have left the store without buying one. Unfortunately, since we live so far away, most of the things I bought will only arrive tomorrow, but it's okay; one night sleeping on an inflatable mattress won't be a problem for me. I've slept in worse places. ^^ After buying the furniture for my house, Sandy and I went to some suppliers to get products to sell in our store. Since the store idea was Sandy's, I let her search for the suppliers. She partnered with some seed and home decoration suppliers, so the store will have a nice variety of products for sale. I can't wait for the opening day.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_19": "Fall 22 ^^ We opened the store today, and practically all the villagers came for the grand opening. Even some people from the city showed up. It was a great day for both of us. Sandy was very happy to see how busy the store was on the first day. I'm sure the store will be a success. ^^ While the store was open, I received a call from an unknown number. I was a bit scared, thinking Ricky had discovered my number again, but I took a deep breath and thought rationally: Ricky hasn't bothered me since the day I moved to the valley, and now that he's on the run, he certainly wouldn't be able to find my new number. If he really wanted to, he would have done it by now. ^^ So I went up to my house and answered the phone. I heard the voice of someone I haven't spoken to in years: my father. I didn't expect to hear his voice after so long, I was very surprised. I asked him how he had found out that I was in Stardew Valley. He told me that he had tried to visit me at my old apartment, but couldn't find me, so he asked Dalia to give him my current number, and that's when he found out that I had moved. ^^ Although I was happy to hear his voice after so long, I didn't understand why he was looking for me. He had distanced himself from me more and more after my mother was institutionalized, to the point where I simply decided to leave. But I understood why he called when he handed the phone to my mother. She finally left the psychiatric clinic and is fully recovered. It was so good to hear her voice; I wish I could be there to give her a hug. ^^ We talked for a long time, and my father said they would come visit me someday. I'm happy that my father has regained his joy in life after having my mother back. He really loves her so much. ^^ I have reasons to be angry with my father. I went through terrible times when my mother was institutionalized, but I'm not angry with him. Because even though he made a lot of mistakes, when I decided to leave, he regretted the things he put me through. At the time, I pretended not to hear and left, but later I realized that he wasn't well enough to take care of me. He was lost, but I was too selfish to notice. ^^ After spending some time talking to my parents, I left Sandy in charge of the store and went to the Saloon to spend some time thinking. While I was there, I saw Willy, the fisherman from Pelican Town. He had just returned from a fishing trip. I heard him talking about a place called Ginger Island, a deserted island that's part of the Fern Islands archipelago. ^^ I'd never heard of this place before, and it piqued my interest; I could study this island and use it as a topic for my thesis, so I went to talk to him about it. He told me that it's a very large and unexplored island; he himself doesn't know exactly what's in the interior of the island since he only stayed on the coast. The only thing he knows is that there's a volcano in the interior of the island, but he doesn't know if it's active or not. ^^ About studying the place for my thesis, he said that it's too dangerous and that he doesn't want to disturb the island's ecosystem. He's right, but the type of research I intend to do won't disturb the island's ecosystem. I'll just write details about the things I find there and use them as research material for my thesis. Of course, I understand his concern; he's not obligated to understand my purposes at first. So I'll try to convince him to take me there, especially since there are three seasons left before my vacation ends, and I want to have a subject for my thesis as soon as possible.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_20": "Fall 25 ^^ I finally managed to convince Willy to take me to Ginger Island. After explaining to him the importance of the thesis and that my research would be purely observational and without interfering with the environment, he agreed to take me. He'll take me there tomorrow and bring me supplies every Sunday. I'm very happy that he agreed to take me there. Now I have to prepare for the trip and take everything I need. ^^ I told Sandy about my trip, and she was surprised. After all, it hasn't even been a week since I moved, and I already have to travel again. Unfortunately, that's how it is for students; it feels like time goes by faster when we're doing something unrelated to our studies. ^^ I also called my parents to tell them about my trip so they wouldn't worry if I didn't answer their calls. They wished me a good trip and said they'll send letters. I'm very happy to have my parents back together; they're both so happy. I wish I could be there to give them a hug. I hope they can visit me at the end of the year.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_21": "Fall 26 ^^ I'm on Ginger Island. This island is really huge, with many places to explore and beautiful landscapes. Besides being a great place for my research, it will be a perfect place to spend the rest of my vacation. I have this whole island to myself; it's a true paradise! But of course, I didn't come here for leisure. I came here to study. Exploring the island's surroundings, I've already found a lot of interesting things. I'm sure my thesis will turn out excellent. ^^ While I was exploring the island looking for something interesting, I saw a small cabin overlooking the sea. It seems like a farm, but it's completely abandoned. It was probably built by a group of people who were shipwrecked here since it's possible to see a stranded ship on the coast. I wonder what happened to those people. ^^ After this little exploration, I gathered some branches to make a fire and set up my tent near the beach to spend the night. This might be one of my best nights to sleep. Everything is so quiet; I only hear the sound of the sea and the crickets. I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_22": "Fall 27 ^^ My first night on Ginger Island was pleasant. It was very relaxing to sleep with the sounds of nature, but for some reason, I felt a strange presence on the island, as if there was someone else here besides me. It must be some kind of anxiety about being totally alone on the island; it should pass in a few days. ^^ Anyway, today I found a kind of slime that's very different from those found elsewhere: orange slimes. They seem to be made of pure magma. I've never seen slimes of that color; it could be a species that only exists on Ginger Island. This island holds many secrets. I'm very excited to be the first person to discover them.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_23": "Winter 4 ^^ I don't think I'm totally alone here. I've been on this island for a few days now and this feeling of being watched hasn't gone away. It's very strange. I'm starting to think there's a reason I feel this way. If it were just a reaction to isolation, it would have passed by now. Maybe this is a sign to be careful. I'll pay more attention to the island's surroundings while I'm exploring.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_24": "Winter 7 ^^ I'm definitely not alone on this island as I thought I was. I swear I saw someone hiding in the bushes this morning while I was studying some plants. I don't know if this person is watching me or if it's just paranoia, but even if it is paranoia, knowing that you're not alone on an island that should theoretically be deserted doesn't give me a sense of security. ^^ Just in case, I've decided that from now on, I'll take shelter in the old cabin I found a few days ago. At least I'll be safe if this person wants to do something. ^^ Coming to Ginger Island was a wonderful idea, but discovering that I'm not alone here is making me rethink things. I might be in real danger here, but I'll be careful and keep an eye on this person's movements.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_25": "Winter 10 ^^ Being on this island knowing that I'm not alone is making me uncomfortable. Even though this person does nothing but stand there watching me from a distance, I'm scared. What if this person is just waiting for the right moment to do something? What if this inertia is just a facade? If a person stalking you and making you feel in constant danger is scary, someone who just watches you without making their intentions clear is even more terrifying. ^^ Despite this, I'm making good progress in my research, which means I'll be leaving this island soon. If this person intends to do anything to me (which I hope they don't), they'd better hurry.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_26": "Winter 13 ^^ Today I decided to take a break from my research and relax a little on the beaches of Ginger Island. I haven't even been in the water since the day I arrived. Plus, I wanted to take advantage of the fact that the person who had been watching me had stopped over the past few days. But that peace didn't last long, because there he was, staring at the ocean. ^^ I could finally see this person more clearly: it was a slightly chubby man dressed in black with shiny details that looked like stars. He also wore a hat with the same details. But there was something about him that was even more eye-catching: the color of his skin was blue, like the sky. I've never seen someone with that skin color; it's so unique. ^^ Of course, as he was nearby, I tried to get his attention. I wanted to know why he was watching me. When he saw me, he tried to run, but I chased after him. I wasn't going to let him escape without giving me an explanation. Looking back now, that idea could have gone very wrong, but I don't know what came over me at the moment. ^^ I followed him until he entered a room inside a large rock. He tried to keep me out by holding the door shut, but I was so determined to get inside that I broke it down. When I entered the room where he was hiding, I was confused by what I found: there was a big screen showing a map of Ginger Island, some computers, and a bed. Apparently, he was living on the island. ^^ He was angry that I broke down the door (rightly so). He said that I shouldn't be there and that I wasn't even supposed to have seen him. I was revolted by what he said. If he didn't want me to see him, why was he watching me? When I questioned him about it, he said that he wasn't watching me, he was just \"living his life\" and that it wasn't his fault if I was always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even though he claimed he wasn't watching me, he knew a lot about me; things he would only know if he knew me, which didn't make sense. After all, how could he know so much about me without observing me? ^^ I questioned him about this, and he told me that knowing many things was one of his powers as \"Mister Qi.\" He said his goal as Mister Qi is to maintain the balance of resources in the world, and knowing many things is a consequence of his powers. ^^ All this talk sounded crazy, and of course I didn't believe it at first. But to prove that he was telling the truth, he did something to me that made me feel a deep connection with him. It was like I could hear him inside my head. But not only that, I could see several things happening around the world at the same time, as if I had been transported into a large room with many cameras where I could see the entire world. I even saw my parents together at home and Ricky in what seemed to be a police chase. ^^ Suddenly, I felt a strong tightening in my chest and a sense of dread. It seemed like I was facing a great danger, and then, in the blink of an eye, I was back in that room looking at that man. That's when I realized that I was facing an extremely powerful being. ^^ All that was new to me. I wasn't expecting to discover that there is a magical being that controls the world and that I was facing one of them. This island hides many surprises. He apologized for almost killing me and asked that I not include anything about the Misters Qi in my thesis. Obviously, I wasn't planning on putting anything about the Misters Qi in the thesis; it would be insane and probably no one would believe it. But he was so worried about it that I had to promise not to write anything. ^^ Of course, I'm not foolish, so we made a deal: in exchange for keeping the secret, he would help me with my research, and he surprisingly agreed. From now on, we're working together. ^^ This guy revealed a lot about the Misters Qi, but he only didn't want to reveal one thing: his name. I tried asking, but he said I should call him Mr. Qi and that his name didn't matter. If he didn't want to reveal his name, I'll call him Azure. He hated the nickname, but I won't call him anything else until he tells me his real name.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_27": "Winter 15 ^^ It seems that everything Azure told me was true. He really does seem to be someone who has lived through a lot in the past. Even though I felt he was telling the truth, I still had doubts, but now I'm certain: he really was telling the truth. ^^ While we were analyzing some slimes, we found those orange-colored slimes that I discovered a few days ago. I asked if he knew anything about them, and of course, he did. He said they're slimes that only exist on Ginger Island. He calls them Tiger Slimes, but they don't have an official name since they haven't been discovered by any scientist. ^^ Knowing this made me surprised and proud. Just imagine a student discovering a new species and writing a thesis about it? It would be an excellent topic! It would bring great recognition to me and the college. Teaming up with Azure was an excellent idea. With his help, my thesis will be the best ever.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_28": "Winter 19 ^^ Willy showed up today to bring the supplies for me, as we had agreed. He also brought a letter from Dalia. She sent a picture from a trip she was taking with her sister and husband. She wrote that she misses me, and I miss her too. We both planned to go on this trip together, but unfortunately, things with Ricky and the move to Stardew Valley didn't allow it to happen. I'm happy she found someone else to go with her. If I had a camera, I'd take some pictures of the island to send back, but unfortunately, I don't. So I just told her that I'm on a paradise island to find inspiration for my thesis. ^^ I was tempted to tell her about Azure, but he said I had to keep his existence a secret. I won't break my promise. I'll only say something if he loosens the terms of this promise, and there's also the fact that he's always watching me, so even if I wanted to, I couldn't talk about him without him finding out. I don't want to get into trouble with someone so powerful. ^^ Speaking of Azure, today he spent the whole day locked in that room. He didn't come out at any time during the day; he only came out after Willy left the island in the late afternoon. Probably because he doesn't want anyone else to see him. Since he had gone out later in the evening and I had already finished my studies for the day, I decided to try talking to him in an attempt to get to know him better. Maybe it would've been better to talk to the rocks; maybe they would respond. ^^ I tried my best to get any information out of him, but he's very reserved. He always says \"You don't need to know,\" \"That's not relevant,\" or just stays silent. The only question he answers differently is about his name. He always says that I should call him \"Mr. Qi\" and that I need to stop calling him Azure. ^^ If it continues like this, it'll be hard to maintain a lasting partnership, but I understand him; he doesn't owe me any explanations. But it would be polite to answer the more important questions so that I could trust him more. But if he wants to stay distant, that's okay.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_29": "Winter 26 ^^ Today was a relatively normal day in my research, which means I had a chance to try to talk to Azure. Actually, talking to him today was easier than it usually is. He was answering most of the questions I asked. To be honest, this change in behavior made me suspicious; he changed so suddenly that something felt off. ^^ I asked him what happened to make him change so much overnight, and he said, without a hint of shame, that he was following the \"advice\" I wrote in my diary a few days ago. He'd been reading my diary with his powers. I was furious; after all, this place is mine alone. ^^ I asked him why he was invading my privacy. He said it was a consequence of seeing everything that happens in the world and that he wasn't actually reading the entries; he was just watching me write them, which is still an invasion of privacy. ^^ He was confused and asked why I was angry if he was \"acting politely,\" as I wanted him to. I had to explain that I wasn't angry at his behavior but at what he did to figure out that I wanted him to act that way. Invading my privacy is a low blow. ^^ Only after explaining this did he seem to understand the mistake he had made. I asked him how long he'd been watching me write diary entries, and he said that he'd been doing it since the day I arrived on the island but that he didn't pay much attention to what I wrote because, in his words, \"There was nothing relevant.\" Despite this, he said he hadn't done it intentionally; he just took into account something I wrote in a single entry. Even so, I made him promise that he wouldn't see me writing diary entries using his powers anymore. He said he can't guarantee it, but he'll try to ignore it. I hope you really will, Azure!",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_30": "Winter 28 ^^ Today is the last day of the year, but even though it's a holiday, Willy still came to the island to bring the supplies I need. Willy is a man of his word; even on the last day of the year, he brought everything. I even asked why he came here during a holiday, and he replied that New Year's Eve isn't a holiday in the Ferngill Republic, so that's why he came. I was surprised to hear that. I thought New Year's Eve was a holiday everywhere, but it seems it's only a tradition in the Gotoro Empire. Anyway, he also brought me some letters. ^^ My parents sent a letter with a postcard of a beach they planned to visit for the New Year's Eve; probably they're both there. Since my mother left the psychiatric clinic, things seem to have gone back to how they used to be. We used to go to the beach on New Year's Eve. It's a shame I can't be there with them. I also received a letter from Sandy about our store's performance so far. The sales have been excellent; most customers are tourists visiting Stardew Valley. I was surprised by the results; we sold far more than I expected. Sandy is an amazing salesperson. ^^ After Willy left, Azure showed up. I decided to spend the New Year's Eve talking to him since he's the only other person on this island besides me. We talked about various things, and I eventually asked him if he had always known he was a Mister Qi or if he discovered it over time. I expected him to say he'd always known, but I was surprised when he said no. He said he only discovered it in his teens. When I heard that, I asked him what his life was like before he found out. ^^ He started talking about his childhood. At that time, he could hear the \"ancestral\" Misters Qi talking to him, but he thought they were just imaginary friends, as they never mentioned he was a Mister Qi. He was an ordinary child, like any other. This surprised me; after all, I never would've imagined he could have had a normal life. It seems so... unreal, considering all his power. I even thought he was lying, but he was being sincere; it was evident in his voice. ^^ He continued to talk about how his \"imaginary friends\" made him feel a little less lonely during his childhood since other kids thought he was strange due to his unusual appearance and behavior. He had few real friends, so he often played with his \"imaginary friends,\" which made him even stranger from an outside perspective. But despite being strange, people always said he was a prodigy because he was much more advanced than other children his age. ^^ Until that point, he was just a relatively normal child, but as he got older, his Mister Qi powers began to strengthen. What started as dreams of being in places he'd never been before evolved into quick flashes of different things happening simultaneously at random times of the day. This terrified him a lot. ^^ When he thought he was going crazy, his \"imaginary friends\" began to reveal themselves. They were the \"previous Misters Qi.\" They explained to him that he was a Mister Qi and his responsibilities, but before he could carry out his mission in the world, he'd have to wait for all his powers to manifest. Azure said his teenage years were very chaotic because of this. ^^ I asked him if there was a significant moment from that time, and he mentioned the day he discovered he could mentally connect with others. He told me how it happened: still in school, a classmate asked him to rewrite a love letter the boy had written, as Azure had the most beautiful handwriting in class. But the boy asked Azure to deliver it to the other boy in the class on his behalf because he was too embarrassed to deliver it in person. ^^ And so he did. During recess, Azure rewrote the letter, and before the next class started, he went to the other boy's desk and handed the letter to him. But as soon as the boy touched the letter Azure was holding, something strange happened. Azure said it felt like a force pulling their minds toward each other. Suddenly, he saw several flashes of scenes from the boy's life: he had access to the boy's memories, fears, and even emotions. ^^ They were so connected that they were able to talk to each other inside the boy's mind. He said he can even remember the conversation they had: ^\"What's going on? How are you here?\" The boy asked, terrified.^\"I don't know! I just wanted to give you the letter Kyle asked me to write. I didn't mean to do this!\" Azure replied.^\"Do you know what we have to do to get out of here?\" Azure shook his head to say no. ^^ The two were at a loss for a few moments until the boy began to suffocate, and then the connection was broken. The boy hadn't been breathing the entire time they were connected. Luckily, the connection only lasted a few seconds. Azure apologized to the boy for what happened. After that, the connections became much more frequent. He didn't even need to touch people; a simple eye contact was enough for him to invade people's minds unintentionally. ^^ The previous Misters Qi had told him this was one of his most important powers, as it allowed him to deeply understand everyone's needs and make wise decisions. He realized how dangerous his powers could be and that he needed to use them cautiously, even if he couldn't control them yet. So he decided to isolate himself to keep everyone safe. ^^ After hearing his whole story, I sat in silence, trying to process everything. He suffered a lot trying to understand his powers and had to distance himself from everyone so that no one would get hurt. I decided to ask him something: \"If you could go back in time and choose to live as a normal person, without powers, would you do it?\" He looked at the ocean for a few moments, got up, and walked away. I think that was his way of saying no, or maybe I had hurt his feelings somehow... I tried to apologize, but he didn't hear me. I returned to the cabin burdened with guilt. ^^ I don't know if it's already the next day or not; I was asleep when I woke up to some knocks on the door. It was Azure. I opened the door for him and asked why he was knocking so late. All he said was \"Yes.\" I was confused, so he told me that if he had the chance to live without his powers, he would. I was surprised; I hadn't expected him to reflect on the question I'd asked. ^^ He added: \"I'm not dissatisfied with the life I have now. My powers have allowed me to discover my purpose in this world, but at the same time, they've prevented me from having certain experiences. Being an ordinary human, I would have had those experiences. Our responsibility is enormous, and our conversation made me realize that it's unfair for it to fall on just one person. Being ordinary seems, in a way, liberating.\" ^^ Hearing that from Azure was surprising. Since the day I met him, he always seemed so confident and unshakeable, but our conversation seems to have brought back a little of his human side. It's even touching to know that deep down, he just wanted to be an ordinary person. ^^ The conversation we had today changed the way I see Azure: he's not a mystical and powerful being; he's a human being who had the misfortune of being called to a mission he never wanted.",

She saw this trip as a great opportunity to come up with a topic for her thesis, which she would start producing as soon as her vacation was over.",

After all, she had already seen what she shouldn't have.#$b#She was supposed to keep it a secret, so we made a deal: she would keep the secret if I helped her with the research, and to keep the secret, I had to accept.",
	"Event-06.MrQiRealNPC.AHiddenPain.11": "We'd meet up several times during the day. She'd tell me about her new discoveries, and I'd help her unravel the mysteries of the island.#$b#Despite the challenge, it was a fair exchange, and our relationship grew stronger.",

I couldn't let a simple chemical reaction in my brain distract me from my goal.#$b#At that point, I couldn't ignore that feeling anymore. The more I tried to repress it, the worse it would get.#$b#So I decided to tell Mona how I felt, so that I could get rid of that weight. If Mona left and I didn't tell her how I felt about her, I would feel very bad.#$b#What I didn't expect was for the feeling to be reciprocated.
