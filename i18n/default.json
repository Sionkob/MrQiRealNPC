	//Introduction
	"Qi.MrQiAndClubIntroduction": "Well, I knew you'd get to this place someday.#$b#From now on, you are part of my club, {{NameOrKid}}. Come whenever you want to spend some time.#$e#Just be careful not to get addicted to those gambling games, I don't want to deal with that kind of problem.#$b#Dealing with Welwick's alcoholism is enough.$u",

	//Spring
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_1": "A new year just started, surely this means something to you, right?#$b#For me, this means that the work is just beginning, I have a lot of things to do.#$b#So, if you'll excuse me...",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_12": "I know that tomorrow the villagers of the Valley will have a celebration called \"Egg Festival\".#$b#I wonder why they celebrate this, there is no special date on this day.#$b#Even so, each people has its own culture, I cannot judge them for that.#$e#Don't expect me to be there. And if I am, you'll have to struggle to find me in the crowd!",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_23": "Tomorrow will be a busy day for the villagers, especially the single ones.#$b#The Flower Dance festival is one of those festivals where people humble themselves to be part of the tradition.#$b#I hope you already have a dance partner, {{NameOrKid}}. And if you don't have one, don't bother people asking if they want to dance with you, it's humiliating and embarrassing.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_28": "Summer is coming, the heat wave will be great at this time of the year.#$b#So, if you want, you can come to the club and enjoy the air-conditioned environment.#$b#And who knows, have a little fun in the games and earn some money?",

	//Summer
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_1": "I hope you've prepared your farm for this new season, some crops are quite profitable this time of year.#$b#I can give you some tips on that if you want.#$b#Anyway, have a nice summer, {{NameOrKid}}.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_10": "Tomorrow will be Luau day, the villagers gather their best ingredients to make a soup for the governor to try...#$b#The governor trusts people so much... Someone could easily poison the soup, it's a little dangerous.#$b#I would never taste that soup, for reasons of hygiene.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_27": "The migration of the Moonlight Jellies is quite a spectacle for the villagers, but not for me.#$b#Those invertebrates are very simple creatures, they just follow their instinct and swim around, there is nothing amazing about them.#$b#But it seems that bioluminescence leaves the villagers in awe, they find something as simple as lights a beautiful spectacle.#$b#Their attention is focused only on the light emitted, they are like moths being attracted to a lamp.",

	//Fall
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_1": "Well... What to say about autumn? It's a time of transition between summer and winter, it's the season when the leaves fall to the ground.#$b#But there are places where the differences between these seasons are not so noticeable. In tropical places, there is little difference between the seasons, they can be easily confused.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_15": "Ah... the Stardew Valley Fair, what a silly and insignificant festivity.#$b#It seems that people don't have the minimum effort to achieve excellence, they always bring mediocre products and expect to get high points for doing the minimum expected of them.$u#$b#Even the champion has weak products with little value. They may even be varied, but there's no point in having a great variety of products if they are ordinary.#$b#This is the fault of the appraiser who is not judicious enough. I'm sure that if he were stricter, the fair's participants would put in much more effort to reach first place.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_26": "Spirit's Eve is a good festival, it has interesting things to see.#$b#That man from the Adventurers' Guild always brings some monsters to the exhibition. It's not that hard to do, but it's a risk that the villagers usually don't want to take.",

	//Winter
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_1": "Winter is a good time to relax, as you don't have to tend to crops.#$b#But it is also a time when you can focus on other activities. You can fish, mine, and foraging.#$b#But if you don't want to do any of that, come spend some time in the casino.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_7": "The Festival of Ice, it's so... boring.#$b#Some people make ice sculptures, some people make snowmen. It's such a monotonous thing, there's nothing interesting about it.#$b#But I know there's a fishing competition, so I hope you have good fishing skills if you decide to participate.#$e#You must have a certain skill with this, right? Never enter a competition if you're not going to win.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_17": "Today is the last day of the Night Market, there are many interesting things that those merchants sell. Things that interest me.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_24": "Hello, {{NameOrKid}}. Tomorrow will have the Winter Star Festival, the villagers will do the traditional gift exchange among themselves.#$b#Do you already know what to give your secret friend?",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_26": "Hey @, the day I told you the truth about me, you said you were scared of me...$s#$b#So I wanted to ask you something...",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_28": "Today I'm going to be away from the casino for a while, it's very tiring to deal with the people there...",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon2-RomanceableQi": "Hey @, my room has a much lighter atmosphere now that you've helped me get rid of Mona's clothes.$h#$b#Knowing that those clothes were still there made the experience of being in that place extremely terrible, it was as if I went back to the day of the accident every time I entered.#$b#But now my room seems much calmer and more peaceful to me, as it should be.

	"Event-05.MrQiRealNPC.ProperlyExplanations.08": "No, right? Just as I imagined.#$b#Well, I know about a lot of things in the world because I'm one of the many manifestations of a consciousness that has been passed on between different beings over the ages.",
