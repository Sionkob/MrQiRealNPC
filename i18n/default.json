	//Introduction
	"Qi.MrQiAndClubIntroduction": "Well, I knew you'd get to this place someday.#$b#From now on, you are part of my club, {{NameOrKid}}. Come whenever you want to spend some time.#$e#Just be careful not to get addicted to those gambling games. I don't want to deal with that kind of problem.#$b#Dealing with Welwick's alcoholism is enough.$u",

	//Spring
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_1": "A new year just started, surely this means something to you, right?#$b#For me, this means that the work is just beginning. I have a lot of things to do.#$b#So, if you'll excuse me...",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_12": "I know that tomorrow the villagers of the Valley will have a celebration called \"Egg Festival\".#$b#I wonder why they celebrate this; there is no special date on this day.#$b#Even so, each people has their own culture. I cannot judge them for that.#$e#Don't expect me to be there, and if I am, you'll have to struggle to find me in the crowd!",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_23": "Tomorrow will be a busy day for the villagers, especially the single ones.#$b#The Flower Dance festival is one of those festivals where people humble themselves to be part of the tradition.#$b#I hope you already have a dance partner, {{NameOrKid}}. And if you don't have one, don't bother people by asking if they want to dance with you; it's humiliating and embarrassing.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.spring_28": "Summer is coming; the heat wave will be great at this time of the year.#$b#So, if you want, you can come to the club and enjoy the air-conditioned environment.#$b#And who knows, maybe you can have some fun playing games and earn some money?",

	//Summer
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_1": "I hope you've prepared your farm for this new season. Some crops are quite profitable this time of year.#$b#I can give you some tips on that if you want.#$b#Anyway, have a nice summer, {{NameOrKid}}.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_10": "Tomorrow will be Luau day; the villagers gather their best ingredients to make a soup for the governor to try...#$b#The governor trusts people so much... Someone could easily poison the soup; it's a little dangerous.#$b#I would never taste that soup for reasons of hygiene.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.summer_27": "The migration of the Moonlight Jellies is quite a spectacle for the villagers, but not for me.#$b#Those invertebrates are very simple creatures. They just follow their instinct and swim around; there is nothing amazing about them.#$b#But it seems that bioluminescence leaves the villagers in awe. They find something as simple as lights to be a beautiful spectacle.#$b#Their attention is focused only on the light emitted. They are like moths being attracted to a lamp.",

	//Fall
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_1": "Well... What to say about autumn? It's a time of transition between summer and winter; it's the season when the leaves fall to the ground.#$b#But there are places where the differences between these seasons are not so noticeable. In tropical places, there is little difference between the seasons; they can be easily confused.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_15": "Ah... the Stardew Valley Fair, what a silly and insignificant festivity.#$b#It seems that people don't make the minimum effort to achieve excellence. They always bring mediocre products and expect to get high points for doing the minimum expected of them.$u#$b#Even the champion has weak products with little value. They may even be varied, but there's no point in having a great variety of products if they are ordinary.#$b#This is the fault of the appraiser, who is not judicious enough. I'm sure that if he were stricter, the fair's participants would put in much more effort to reach first place.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.fall_26": "Spirit's Eve is a good festival; it has interesting things to see.#$b#That man from the Adventurers Guild always brings some monsters to the exhibition. It's not that hard to do, but it's a risk that the villagers usually don't want to take.",

	//Winter
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_1": "Winter is a good time to relax, as you don't have to tend to crops.#$b#But it is also a time when you can focus on other activities. You can fish, mine, and forage.#$b#But if you don't want to do any of that, come spend some time in the casino.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_7": "The Festival of Ice is so... boring.#$b#Some people make ice sculptures, and some make snowmen. It's such a monotonous thing; there's nothing interesting about it.#$b#But I know there's a fishing competition, so I hope you have good fishing skills if you decide to participate.#$e#You must have some skill in this, right? Never enter a competition if you're not going to win.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_17": "Today is the last day of the Night Market; there are many interesting things that those merchants sell. Things that interest me.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_24": "Hello, {{NameOrKid}}. Tomorrow will be the Winter Star Festival; the villagers will do the traditional gift exchange among themselves.#$b#Do you already know what to give your secret friend?",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_26": "Hey @, the day I told you the truth about me, you said you were scared of me...$s#$b#So I wanted to ask you something...",
	"Qi.Dialogue.winter_28": "Today I'm going to be away from the casino for a while. It's very tiring to deal with the people there...",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri": "The casino is a great place to spend the weekend. Come to the casino whenever you like.#$b#Just don't drink too much, or you'll be like Welwick.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat": "Want some advice?#$b#Never stop striving to achieve perfection.#$b#Settle for nothing less than excellence in everything you do.#$b#Trust me, seeing the result of all your hard work is very satisfying.",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue2": "You are making good progress on your farm, {{NameOrKid}}. Keep it up and you'll go even further.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed2": "Here's a tip for when you go mining: Always take food with you when you enter the mines.#$b#Food can help you recover energy so you can spend more time mining.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu2": "Have you heard of the Prismatic Shard?#$b#It's a stone that has an extremely colorful shine. Nobody knows for sure its origin; it's very rare to be found.#$b#I remember the first time I saw one. Its glow was so beautiful; it was impressive. I even thought it was radioactive given all the brightness, but it's not.#$b#Maybe someday you'll find one. Here's a tip: You're more likely to find one in the deep levels of the Skull Cavern.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri2": "You know that guy selling the Statue of Endless Fortune for 1 million gold?#$b#It is a very useful statue to have in your home, as well as being a great decorative piece.#$b#But it's not the only useful statue you can get, there are other statues even more useful than it.#$e#What are they? Keep exploring this world and you will soon find out, {{NameOrKid}}.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat2": "How's your weekend going so far, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#Whenever you're bored, you can come to the casino and spend some time playing CalicoJack or testing your luck on the slot machines.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun2": "Welwick said she wouldn't drink too much today. Knowing her, I know she won't be able to control herself...$u#$b#She needs help to overcome her drinking problem, but there's not much you can do when someone doesn't want to be helped.$u",

	//Days Of Week - 4 Hearts (As Non-Romanceable Option)
	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon4": "Hi, {{NameOrKid}}. I hope you're having a good day.#$b#Whenever you want to spend some time, come and have fun at the casino.#$e#If you find anyone cheating, please let me know. I will take care of it.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue4": "The salesperson downstairs is Sandy. She's part of my select group of 'friends' in the valley.#$b#Well, friends in quotes, since we've never exchanged more than five words since we met. She only sees me on the day she gets her paycheck.#$b#She doesn't know much about me, and I hope she never does.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed4": "Are you practicing your other skills besides harvesting, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#If you want to achieve excellence, you have to be good at all your skills. As they say: Practice makes perfect.#$b#Life is only fun when we practice something different and challenge ourselves to always overcome our barriers; we shouldn't accept becoming stagnant in one place.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu4": "Sandy always asks to come into the casino, but I don't allow her in here, even though I know her and know she can keep it a secret.#$b#I don't think she's the kind of person who can hang out in a casino... She could cause problems with that personality of hers.$u#$b#It takes a certain responsibility to enter a casino; otherwise you can... Well, get addicted.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri4": "Have you ever bought anything with the Qi coins you earn in the casino games? You can buy many rare and useful items with them.#$b#That guy next to the hallway leading to my room sells some interesting items. You should take a look; maybe there is something of interest to you.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat4": "There are many languages in the world; each one has its own particularities. Some are more difficult to learn than others.#$b#One language that is more difficult to learn is the Dwarvish language. It takes a lot of study and interaction with dwarves to learn this language.#$e#Op ah taitsu, E om hniun e nhes noliolu, os yunn os mool adoot noliolus. E om hniun e ool noliolu olai to emoleu.#$b#Maybe someday you'll be able to understand what I said, {{NameOrKid}}.", //The Dwarvish text was made with the Dwarvish Translator by Kdau (https://www.kdau.com/dwarvish).

	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat4.HasDwarvishGuide": "There are many languages in the world; each one has its own particularities. Some are more difficult to learn than others.#$b#One language that is more difficult to learn is the Dwarvish language. It takes a lot of study and interaction with dwarves to learn this language.#$e#And of course, I am fluent in this language, as well as many other languages. I am fluent in any language you can imagine.#$b#Oh, did you understand what I said? Congratulations, it means you are exploring this world and discovering new things.

I hate friendship for gain.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed6": "You've already seen a Junimo, right?#$b#They are mysterious spirits who live hidden in the woods, and their mission is to protect these places from possible dangers.#$b#They are harmless to humans and can even be used for your own benefit. You can build a Junimo Hut on your farm, and they'll harvest your crops for you.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu6": "It seems like you come to the desert often, don't you, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#I hope you're using a warp totem instead of having to spend 500 gold on every trip.#$e#Have you seen those strange statues that stand in some places in the valley? They are warp points.

	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri6": "Hey, {{NameOrKid}}, I'm doing some experiments and I need someone to test them out.

I never risk people's lives in my experiments, let alone yours.#$b#You need to be healthy to be able to work on your farm, don't you?",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat6": "Can I tell you something, {{NameOrKid}}?#$b#Those things in my room are purely decorative; it's just to not leave so much empty space, you know?#$b#I don't use them very often; I can't even remember the last time I turned on that sound system. It's too loud, and I hate noisy things.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun6": "For some people, Sundays are boring, but not for me.#$b#Sundays are days to try something new.#$b#Why not spend some time playing in the casino when you get off work? You deserve a break after working on your farm all day.",

	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue8": "%Mister Qi looks a little tired.#$e#Oh, I'm sorry, @. Last night I had to talk to an ancestor using my Spiritual Representation. It's a bit tiring to do this at night because I need to concentrate to maintain communication.#$b#The Spiritual Representation needs me to be conscious so that it has the ability to reply to other beings in the spiritual world, so I was awake longer than I should have been.#$e#Who was the ancestor? Well, it was one of the first Misters Qi who existed. He was worried that I was 'revealing too many secrets'.#$b#I understand his concern, but I managed to reassure him, so I think the time I stayed awake was worth it.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed8": "How is your day going, @? I hope everything is alright.#$b#If you want to spend some time, we can arrange a day to play together at the casino. Qi Coins will be on me.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Thu8": "I have to admit that when I opened this casino, I felt a little bad about winning from other people's losses. I make a lot of money from gamblers' losses and the purchase of Qi Coins.#$b#I really didn't like the idea of running a casino here; I'd feel guilty if someone lost everything gambling.#$b#That's why I try to keep this environment free of cheaters, so that every game is as balanced as possible and I don't have to make money that came from an unfair match.#$e#Although I don't think making money in this way is very ethical, unfortunately, it's the way I've found to support myself and the Oasis since the bus broke down.#$b#Or rather, was scrapped by Mayor Lewis. He simply left that bus abandoned, and when it broke down, nobody bothered to fix it until you arrived.$u",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Fri8": "I see you're doing a good job on your farm, @.#$b#Does it have something to do with you knowing what your grandfather expected of you?#$b#In any case, it's great that you're taking care of your farm. Keep it up and you'll reach perfection faster than you think.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sat8": "Hey, @, do you remember the day you reached level 100 of the Skull Cave and found me there?#$b#The one who was talking to you inside and offering you the Iridium Snake Milk was my Semi-Physical Representation. That's why right after you left the cave, I was already at the entrance.#$b#When I decided to do that, I had to be sure that you wouldn't tell anyone what you had seen. That's why I was there at the cave entrance waiting for you.#$b#I can't let just anyone know these details about me; it's too dangerous. The power of the Misters Qi can easily be used for malicious purposes, so I'm cautious about who I tell about my powers.",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun8": "Hello, @. How are you?#$b#I was thinking about leaving the casino for a while today, but there's not much to do here; at most, I can talk to Sandy.#$b#Despite being somewhat energetic, Sandy is a good friend.

	"Qi.Dialogue.Mon10-Before10HeartsEvent": "Taking care of this casino isn't an easy task, even though few people frequent it.#$b#I decided to keep this casino exclusive to people I trust because, at the time, I already knew I couldn't manage a place like this if it were open to the public.#$e#And to think that I once considered opening this place to the public... It would have been a big mistake.$s",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Tue10-Before10HeartsEvent": "Hey @, did you know I'm good at cooking?$h#$b#Yes, I learned to cook thanks to an ancestor who was a chef. The food preparation knowledge he had was passed on to me.#$b#Do you think I made Qi Seasoning by accident? Not at all! I wanted to use this skill I'd acquired to create amazing things.#$b#It's a shame that Qi Seasoning is radioactive... it's not so safe to consume because of that.$s#$b#You can use it in small quantities, as the amount of radiation emitted by the seasoning is reduced by almost 70 percent when compared to the radiation that Stardrop emits when consumed, but it's still there.#$e#If you ever want to taste it, you can come to my room and ask me to prepare something for you.#$b#I won't be using Qi Seasoning, of course.$h",
	"Qi.Dialogue.Wed10-Before10HeartsEvent": "You know @, in the beginning, before I discovered that I was one of the Misters Qi, I was an ordinary boy.#$b#I was still a child, leading an ordinary life: I studied, had friends, and a family. But I always noticed that there was something different about me; I knew things that other people my age wouldn't know.#$b#Many people considered me a prodigy. They asked me how I knew so many things, and I simply couldn't explain it; I just... knew.#$e#I only realized that I was one of the Misters Qi in my early teens. That's when I understood why I knew many things that other people didn't; it was the knowledge of previous Misters Qi that was passed on to me.#$b#I started to listen more carefully to the voices in my head; they were the previous Misters Qi. They explained to me that I was a Mister Qi and told me about my responsibility in the world.#$b#I had a huge responsibility on my hands when I was still a teenager, so I decided to put my ordinary life aside and listen to the advice of past Misters Qi.#$e#It was because of them that I moved to Ginger Island. Many Misters Qi stayed there because it was an isolated place that would allow me to concentrate solely on my mission as a Mister Qi.",

I wrote the text for him, and we put the letter in the guy's notebook and waited for the next class to start.#$b#I remember that when the guy saw the letter and started reading, the first thing he did was look at me because he realized it was my handwriting.

	"Qi.Dialogue.Sun10-Before10HeartsEvent": "Hey @, one of the biggest mistakes a Mister Qi can make is to overestimate their own power.#$b#This error can be fatal, and it's a bit scary to know that many Misters Qi have died because of it.#$b#When a mortal being has too much power in their hands, they tend to think they can do more than they actually can, and in the case of the Misters Qi, this can mean a death sentence.$u#$e#The first Mister Qi in history died too soon because he thought he was a god. He was worshipped by his people and used his powers to fulfill their wishes.#$b#One day, his community was facing a severe drought, which was killing their crops and animals; hunger was spreading through the community, and Mister Qi promised that he would bring heavy rains in the coming days.#$b#We cannot control the weather, and as the days passed and the rain didn't come, the community thought that Mister Qi wanted them to starve.#$b#So, in an act of rebellion, they killed him, and... well, I think it's pretty obvious what they did next.#$b#Of course, he was the first Mister Qi to exist, so he had no idea what he could and couldn't do, but his story served as a lesson for the next Misters Qi.",

But now I understand that I was wrong.#$b#There are things that should be remembered fondly.$h#$e#But I still think that swimsuit is horrible.$u",

	//If you're dating giftable Mr. Qi
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Mon-DatingQi": "Hi, @. Did you come to check out the special orders board? I've put up some new challenges for you to choose from.#$b#But if you don't want to do any challenges this week, that's fine. There's always next week.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Tue-DatingQi": "You know, @, as one of Mr. Qi's representations, I can't quite understand how you and he ended up together.#$b#I wasn't made to have feelings; my sole purpose is to carry out the tasks that all Misters Qi must do.#$b#However, since I'm connected to the Main Representation, everything it feels for you is passed on to me, and I can express it, even though I don't fully understand it.#$e#The Main Representation created us to have personalities based on aspects of itself, but it can make us act differently from the norm according to its will.#$b#We might even try to resist changes when we disagree with them, but it's not always worth it.#$b#It can put us into a forced silence, or worse, erase and replace us with another representation.$u",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Wed-DatingQi": "Hello, it's been a while since you last visited the Walnut Room. Take a look at what you can buy with your Qi Gems; there might be something interesting.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Thu-DatingQi": "Hey, @, do you know a good way to turn your Qi Gems into gold? Buy Qi Seasonings to sell.#$b#They're worth 200 gold each, and you can exchange ten of them for ten Qi Gems. It's a good investment if you don't have anything else to spend your Qi Gems on.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Fri-DatingQi": "Hey, @, have you ever stopped to think about how your relationship with the Main Representation affects the others?#$b#I mean, we're part of the Main Representation, created and controlled by it.#$b#But we also have slightly different personalities, and some of us can't even feel the love the Main Representation feels for you...#$b#So... are you dating just the Main Representation or all of us? I bet you hadn't even considered that, huh?",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Sat-DatingQi": "Always remember to check the perfection tracker to see how close you are to reaching it.#$b#Sometimes, you're just one small detail away from achieving perfection, so it's always a good idea to take a look.",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Sun-DatingQi": "Good morning, @. Hmm, you really seem different today, but I don't know why. I don't see anything different about you physically speaking.#$b#It must be the Main Representation's influence on me. It really likes you.",

	//Attempts to tell what happened (until 5 days after seeing Mr. Qi's 10 hearts event in romance route)
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Attempt1": "I saw you try to read the Summer 8 entry, but the Main Representation wouldn't let you read the whole thing.#$b#The Main Representation was really embarrassed by what Mona wrote. Honestly, I don't see why it acted that way. Mona even kept the details light.#$b#But anyway, what happened was...#$b#%The Semi-Physical Representation of Mr. Qi tries to speak, but no sound comes out of its mouth.#$b#...$u#$b#%The Semi-Physical Representation looks up, enraged, and tries to yell something, but no sound comes out of its mouth. However, you manage to read its lips.#$b#%It says, \"Son of a bitch!\"",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Attempt2": "Ah, @, you still remember the Summer 8 entry, right?#$b#The Main Representation doesn't want you to read the rest of it... but I can try to tell you what happened.#$e#%The Semi-Physical Representation tries to speak, but its speech becomes completely jumbled. You can't understand a thing it says.#$b#*Sigh* The Main Representation didn't let me speak properly. It'll regret this.$u",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Attempt3": "Hey, @, I need to tell you something, but I need to use my computer keyboard for it.#$b#%The Semi-Physical Representation tries to open Notepad on the computer but can't locate the keyboard on the desk.#$b#Damn it! I can't see anything! The Main Representation blinded me!$u#$b#Yeah, it looks like I won't be able to say what I want... Ugh, that Main Representation...$u",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Attempt4": "@, remember the Summer 8 entry in Mona's diary? The Main Representation doesn't want you to read it, but I'm gonna try to tell you anyway.#$b#But since it doesn't want you to know what happened, let's use a code to talk about it.#$b#*Whisper* I'll say random words, and if you take the first letter of each, it'll form the sentence I want to tell you. Got it?#$e#White, Hat, Amber, Treasure, History, Always, Piano, Pencil...#$b#%Before the Semi-Physical Representation can finish, it stops talking and its mouth closes. It tries to pry its mouth open with its hands, but it can't.#$b#...!$u",
	"MrQiNutRoom.Dialogue.Attempt5": "You know, @, the Main Representation is way overreacting to what Mona wrote in that entry.#$b#Seriously, it's acting like Mona wrote something absolutely horrible, but in the end, it's really nothing.#$b#I don't understand why it doesn't want you to know that...#$b#%Mr. Qi's Semi-Physical Representation suddenly stops speaking.#$e#I wasn't even going to say anything! Why does this representation keep silencing me every time? This is getting annoying!$u#$b#You know what? I'm sick of this nonsense; I can't take it anymore! Today, my silence will be of my own free will. I'm not saying another word today.$u",

	/* +++++|MARRIAGE DIALOGUE|+++++ */

	//Spring
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.spring_1": "Hi, honey! Happy new year, and happy spring too!$h#$b#Well, maybe not so much... you always have more work on the first day of the year. It takes a long time to clean up the mess and plant your seeds.$s#$e#With that in mind, I want to try to help you a little. Here, sweetheart: this will help you get things done faster for a while.$h#$action AddItem (O)215 1",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.spring_12": "Tomorrow's the Egg Festival, honey. Are you going? If you are, I'll go too.#$b#By the way, are you going to join the egg hunt? I'm getting tired of seeing that purple-haired girl win every single year...#$b#It's even annoying; they hide the eggs in practically the same spots every year. It's ridiculous that no one else can win the competition.$u#$b#One of these days, it'll be me taking part in the egg hunt.$u",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.spring_14": "Oh, sweetie, tomorrow's the first day of the Desert Festival. I'll have to go there early to help Sandy with a few things.#$b#I might be back pretty late during the festival days, so don't worry about me.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.spring_23": "Tomorrow's the Flower Dance, honey. You know, I think that dance is so weird... I wouldn't agree to join if someone else invited me.#$b#But with you, it's different: seeing your happy face makes it all worth it.$h",

	//Summer
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.summer_1": "Summer is one of the worst seasons for me since I have trouble with heat. I already sweat a lot in any season, but it gets way worse in summer. And at night it's even worse...$s#$b#So, if someday you wake up and notice my side of the bed is wet, it's sweat, not piss.$h#$e#But despite this problem, I've never heard anyone complain that I smell bad, and I'm glad. I hate smelly people and couldn't bear to live with the fact that I'm one.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.summer_10": "The governor's coming tomorrow to taste that crap... I mean, that soup at the Luau.#$b#Have you decided what you're going to put in that thing? I think I'll add some Qi Seasoning, but I have no idea if it'll have any effect. It's not a good idea to overdo it with that seasoning...$u#$e#Still, that soup has so many ingredients mixed together that a little radiation would be the least of its problems...$u",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.summer_12": "Hey, sweetie, I hope you don't mind, but I'm still trying to keep my promise to your grandfather: to help you reach perfection.#$b#I try to stay as neutral as possible and not make things too easy for you, but sometimes it's hard.$h#$b#You know why I'm saying this? Because I want to explain something I do every year to help you, and I think you still don't understand what it means.#$b#You know when the ocean at Stardew Valley beach turns greener? That means there's a better chance of finding forageable items on the beach.#$b#You can earn a good amount of gold selling those items. And guess what? That's happening right now. You have until Sunday to take advantage of it.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.summer_21": "Today's the last day of the Trout Derby; I'm going to check it out. It's interesting to see the effort anglers put into catching a Rainbow Trout with the golden tag.#$b#It's a different kind of festival from the other ones with competitions around here; in this one, the competition and each fisher's effort are real.#$b#In the other festivals, there's little effort to win. It's like they already know who will win and that they won't have a chance.#$b#That's why I don't put much stock in the competitions they hold around here.#$e#But even if the competitions here aren't that interesting, I'm always rooting for you in every single one.$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.summer_26": "Hey, honey, remember I told you I took care of Leo when he was a baby? Well, today's his birthday... and I was thinking of getting him something.#$b#I could never give him a gift before, because it'd be weird for a stranger to give a birthday present to a child.#$b#But he knows you, so I think you can give it to him for me.#$action AddItem (O)444 1#$b#He really likes the color of duck feathers; I think it'll be a good gift. Just don't tell him you're giving it on my behalf; he doesn't need to know that.",

	//Fall
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.fall_1": "Fall's here, honey. The farm must be covered in dry leaves.#$b#If you want, I can clear them for you. You'll already have a lot of work preparing the farm to plant seeds, so it's good to have one less thing to do.$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.fall_10": "You know, honey, the problem with humans being chosen to be Misters Qi is that we're very fragile: we can die from simple things, like accidents or even diseases.#$b#When a human is chosen to be a Mister Qi, it's expected that they won't have a long lifespan. However, our rational thinking compensates for the fragility.#$b#I'm trying to take care of myself so I can live for many years and put an end to this idea that human Misters Qi live shorter lives.#$b#And of course, I'm also doing this so I can stay by your side for as long as possible.$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.fall_15": "The Stardew Valley Fair is tomorrow, sweetie. Do you already know what you're going to put in our farm's grange display? Some villagers are already choosing what they'll display.#$b#If you want to win, my tips are: fill six slots in the display with items from different categories and avoid leaving empty spaces; they lower your final score.#$b#If you follow these tips, I guarantee you'll win, honey!$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.fall_26": "Tomorrow's Spirit's Eve. I'll stop by to see the monsters the Adventurer's Guild captured this year.#$b#I'll also see if Rasmodius will make a decent maze this year. Sometimes he goes too easy on the difficulty—probably because of the kids.#$b#But despite making it too easy, the villagers never manage to reach the end. I think he should stop going easy and show what he's really capable of.",

	//Winter
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_1": "Ah, winter's so nice, isn't it, honey? No crops to take care of, fewer things to do, more time to spend with me...$h#$b#But the cold bothers me a little. I'm not very used to it; I've always lived in warmer places.#$b#I have trouble with heat, but too much cold isn't great either. Balance is everything.#$e#What do you think about spending a few days together on Ginger Island? The weather there is very pleasant, especially this time of year.$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_8": "The Ice Festival starts today at nine in the morning, sweetie. There's the fishing \"competition\" and all that...#$e#Yeah, @, that's not a real competition. They make an artificial pond and fill it with fish.#$b#It's too easy that way: if the pond's full of fish and the space is small, just use better bait and you'll catch more fish.#$b#It's different from a festival like the Trout Derby. In that one, the competition takes place in the Cindersap Forest river, where there's a greater variety of fish and much more space for them to swim.#$b#What determines the winner isn't the best bait, but luck.#$e#But anyway, if you go, I'll go too. Just don't take that competition too seriously; treat it more like a game.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_12": "SquidFest starts today. I'll head over there later to get some squid for an experiment I'm working on. See you there, sweetheart.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_15": "The Night Market opens tonight, sweetie. Is there anything you want to buy or do there?#$b#I'm thinking of going, but only on the last day. You know, I still prefer less crowded places...#$b#Plus, I want to take advantage of the low traffic to talk to some vendor friends at the festival.#$b#If there's anything you want to buy at the festival, just tell me and I'll buy it for you, sweetie.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_25.1": "Happy holidays, sweetheart! This year went by so fast, didn't it?#$b#By the way, today is the villagers' gift exchange. I'm not part of that tradition, but I want to give you this.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_25.2": "I hope you like the gift, honey. Maybe it's not what you expected, but that's the fun of gifts, right?$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.winter_28": "Hi, honey, today's the last day of the year. I'm going out for a walk around the valley to enjoy the end of winter.#$b#But first, let's enjoy this moment together. I brought this back from my last trip to Ginger Island; it's a good alternative to alcoholic stuff.#$action AddItem (O)903 1#$e#Enjoy the end of the year, honey. You'll have a lot of work preparing the farm for spring tomorrow. I can help you a little, if you want.",

	//Leaving Home
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.FunLeave": "I'm heading out today, sweetheart. I have some things to take care of. I'll be back later, okay? I love you.$h",

	//Returning Home
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.FunReturn": "Hi, honey, I just got back! I was counting the hours until I could see you again! I'm so glad you're home too.$h",

	//Rainy Day Dialogues
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyDay-0": "It's raining heavily, isn't it, honey? I like days like this; they make me want to stay in bed all day.$h#$b#I'd love for you to stay home a little longer, but unfortunately, you have other things to do on your farm. Even in the rain, work doesn't stop.#$b#See you tonight, sweetheart.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyDay-1": "Hey, @, I noticed {{AlienName}} has started reacting to the weather. His brain activity increases a lot on rainy days; it's like he's in a constant state of alert.#$b#That's pretty weird, right? Maybe it's better to leave him in the mini lab. This stress could harm his development in the long run.$s",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyDay-2": "In this rainy weather, it's easy to catch a cold. Your immune system weakens and leaves you vulnerable to pathogens in the environment.#$b#So be careful going out in this rain today, sweetie.#$b#Stay away from anyone who's sneezing or coughing; remember to wash your hands before touching your face, and when you get home, take a shower and change your clothes.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyDay-3": "Good morning, sweetie. It's raining cats and dogs out there, isn't it? Anyway, I made your breakfast. I hope you like it.#$action AddItem (O)211 1#$e#Have a good day at work, sweetheart. Be careful that lightning doesn't strike your head!$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyDay-4": "Hey, honey, I feel like playing in the rain. It's silly, I know, but it's been so long since I've done something like that.#$b#Since you won't need to water your crops today, how about we do it together? After all, you're going to get wet anyway.",

	//Rainy Night Dialogues
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight": "Hi, honey, welcome back! How was your work today with all this rain?#$b#Anyway, you'd better change out of those wet clothes before dinner.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight-0": "I'm so glad you're back, sweetie! You took a long time to come back today; I was starting to get worried.#$b#How was your day, honey? Did you find anything interesting along the way?",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight-1": "Tonight will be very comfortable for sleeping. The sound of rain is a great background noise.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight-2.1": "Hi, honey! I made a special dish for dinner! I hope you like it.$h",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight-2.2": "I think this dish will really hit the spot after a whole day working in the rain!",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight-3": "Earlier today, I noticed there's a small leak in the roof. I'll take care of it tomorrow if it's not raining, honey.",
	"Qi.MarriageDialogue.RainyNight-4": "Today was a great day to catch up on my reading. I finally finished a book I started almost a year ago.#$b#Now I'll wait a while before starting another one. Literary fatigue really hit me hard after that book.$h",

	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_1": "Fall 15 ^^ Today was a stressful day. This college is going to drive me crazy. I can't pay much attention in class because I arrive at college tired from my work. I need to hand in a lot of assignments, and I still need to think about the topic for my thesis. I feel like I'm running around like a headless chicken. Sometimes I wonder if all of this will be worth it. ^^ And I still have to deal with Ricky; he's getting more and more annoying. I really don't know what to do anymore. A few hours ago, he came to my house for dinner, even though I told him not to. He just said, \"Deal with it,\" and came over, then sat on the sofa waiting! Seriously, he's so lazy. ^^ When I look back, I think about how stupid I was to fall in love with him. But at the same time, how could I have known that he would become a different person after only two seasons? How could I have known that the loving, understanding, and kind person would turn into someone rude, lazy, and selfish? He doesn't care about my problems; they mean nothing to him.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_2": "Fall 18 ^^ This week has been very difficult. I have a college assignment I need to do, but I can't concentrate anymore. There's so much happening here. Ali told me that my rent will increase next season because a shopping mall is opening nearby. I'm already struggling to pay the rent currently; imagine when it increases? I'm afraid I'll run out of money at the end of the season. I'll try to talk to my boss and see if he can give me a raise. ^^ And Ricky is becoming more and more unbearable. Just yesterday, we had another fight; he was accusing me of not paying attention to him and his problems. How can I do that for him if he doesn't do the same for me? And honestly, what kind of problems could this idiot be going through? Ricky is extremely spoiled; anything that happens, he has his mom fix it. If he expects me to do the same, he can keep waiting. ^^ I don't know how I put up with this guy for two seasons. I think it's time to end this, but I have a lot of other things to do. So for now, I'll leave him in his place and deal with more important things; he doesn't deserve that much attention anyway.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_3": "Fall 26 ^^ Today we were informed that classes for this semester will end next Friday. I was relieved to hear that; it's one less thing to deal with. But despite the relief, I still have to worry about finding a topic for my thesis since next semester is my last, and it's good to have some idea of what to write in advance. But how will I have time to think about this? I have a lot of other problems to solve: there's the rent issue, my raise proposal that was rejected, and I still have to deal with Ricky. My life is full of setbacks, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile my studies with my personal life. ^^ Today, Ricky came here again. This time he was apologizing for what he'd been doing these past few days. He seemed to be sincere, but as soon as I told him about my rent, he went back to being a jerk, refusing to help me and saying, \"You've always managed to get by; why now do you want my help?\" Give me patience, because I don't have any left! ^^ I'm exhausted by all this; Ricky's behavior only stresses me out and distracts me. I need to put an end to this as soon as possible. Maybe then I'll be able to concentrate on my studies. ^^ But I must admit, in Ricky's words, there was some truth: I have always solved these kind of problems on my own. So why did I ask Ricky to help me pay the rent? I really don't know; probably out of desperation.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_4": "Winter 5 ^^ Finally, the semester is over, now I'm on vacation. But being on vacation doesn't mean my work is over; I still have some other issues to resolve. Today, I spoke to Ricky and told him I wanted to break up. And, as expected, he didn't take the breakup very well. He shouted at me and tried to convince me to change my mind, but I'd been determined to break up with him for a while; I just needed to solve my other problems to do it. Knowing that Ricky is out of my life is a relief. ^^ He tried to threaten me, saying that I was making a big mistake, that he wouldn't let me leave his life, that I would regret what I did, and stuff like that; just nonsense. Ricky would never do that kind of thing; he's too lazy to try anything against me. He just tried to scare me so I wouldn't break up. He'll probably just be sad for a few seasons and then try to find another sucker to deceive. ^^ I hope the next unlucky girl realizes the trap before I do.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_5": "Winter 7 ^^ Ricky is crazy! I thought he wouldn't try to do anything against me, but I was wrong. He DEFINITELY can. ^^ Yesterday, he sent me some strange letters threatening me, and in these letters he also sent some photos of me in moments of my routine. I wasn't expecting this from him; it's bizarre! But I wish it was just that. ^^ Today, on my way home from work, I took a taxi, and the driver simply ignored my destination and took me to Ricky's house. He was waiting for me and wanted to talk to me. How did he manage to bribe the taxi guy? Luckily, he didn't want to do anything to me, but it still scared me. It's one more reason to stay away from him; I made sure to file a restraining order against him. I hope this keeps me safe.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_6": "Winter 8 ^^ It seems that Ricky didn't give up so easily. He's tried to call my cell phone number several times since yesterday, but I've already changed my number, so I hope he doesn't find out this new one. But, not satisfied with not being able to call me on my cell phone, now he won't stop calling me on the landline at home. He's going to drive me crazy. If this house weren't rented, I would have smashed that phone on the first call. ^^ And as if that wasn't enough, he found a way to stalk me even with the restraining order: he asks his friends to keep an eye on me. I only found out because, during my break at work, I overheard Ian talking to him about me on the phone. I'm not safe even at work. ^^ I talked about everything that happened with my best friend, Dalia. She was scared when she heard everything Ricky was doing; she said she didn't expect him to do something like this. I think it surprised everyone. ^^ She and her husband also offered to help me. They allowed me to stay at their house until we decide what we're going to do. I'm very grateful to them for letting me stay here; I wouldn't be able to sleep peacefully at home.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_7": "Winter 10 ^^ Being in this city is no longer safe for me. Ricky is stalking me everywhere; he's already found out that I'm living in Dalia's house. Luckily, he can't get in here because of the security guards, but I can't stay here forever. Dalia's husband told me that it would be better if I moved out, so I could start my life again in a new place, away from Ricky. If I'd heard this three days ago, I'd have thought it was an exaggeration, but now I see that it's necessary. He won't leave me alone while I'm here, so I've agreed to move. ^^ Dalia told me about a place that would be perfect for me to start again: Stardew Valley, in the Ferngill Republic. She said it's an isolated region on the other side of the Gem Sea. It sounds like a perfect place for someone who wants to start over, so I decided to move there. Dalia's husband said that he has contact with someone there and will arrange a small apartment for me so that I can arrive in Stardew Valley with a place to live. ^^ However, before I leave, I need to sort out some paperwork at my college. I need to change the mode of my course to a correspondence course, so I can continue my studies even from afar. Luckily, Dalia's husband requested that I be accompanied by security guards while I'm in the city, so at least I can resolve this issue without worrying that someone is watching me. I just hope I can solve this problem quickly.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_8": "Winter 12 ^^ Finally, it's official. I'm now studying by correspondence. Now I can focus on my move to Stardew Valley. Taking advantage of the fact that I was accompanied by security guards, I decided to go into my house again to get the things I had left behind. That house reminded me of the day I moved there... It seemed super quiet, and the neighborhood was very welcoming. The neighbors prepared a small welcome party for me! I met so many friends that day... I hope I also meet some nice people there in Stardew Valley. ^^ I also went to my work to resign, and there was Ian. Before I left, he asked me why I had resigned, as if being watched by a coworker wasn't a good reason to resign. He also asked why I was cheating on Ricky. I was very confused, but then I understood: Ricky told his friends that I was cheating on him and asked them to watch me. Honestly, this surprised me; it's not like him. ^^ Anyway, I told Ian the truth, and he was shocked to hear the whole story and apologized. Ricky had made his friends believe I was a horrible person. He said that Ricky will pay dearly for his lies. I'm not sure how that will happen, but I know he deserves it.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_9": "Winter 14 ^^ Today is the day. The day I'm finally going to Stardew Valley. I thought this day would never come; this week has taken so long to pass. ^^ I'm very anxious, but I hope that this move will bring me the peace I've been looking for, and that I can focus on what really matters.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_10": "Winter 15 ^^ I've just arrived in the Stardew Valley, in a small village called Pelican Town. It was a long journey, and I'm quite tired, but the feeling of calm and tranquillity I felt as soon as I arrived in Pelican Town was so good. Even the air here seems lighter. ^^ However, before I arrived here, at Gotoro Empire Airport, Ricky discovered my phone number again; he doesn't give up. I had to change it again when I passed through a town near here called Zuzu City. I didn't have time to see if there's cell phone signal in Pelican Town, but I hope there is. I want to see that scoundrel Ricky discover this number now. ^^ The apartment that Dalia's husband has rented for me is very cozy, and I've heard that he's already paid for two seasons in advance for me, which is great. I'll have enough time to get a job and support myself.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_11": "Winter 16 ^^ My first day in Pelican Town was much busier than I expected. Early in the morning, while taking a walk to get to know the town better, I met an elderly woman tending to some flower beds in the village; it was Evelyn. She's a very nice person; she even reminds me a bit of my mother with her caring nature. She invited me to her house to try some cookies, and they were delicious! I also met her husband, George. He seems a bit grumpy, but I could see in his eyes how much he loves Evelyn. Evelyn wanted me to stay to meet her grandson, Alex, but I preferred to leave and continue exploring the village. ^^ While I was walking around the village, I went into a place called \"Pierre's General Store\" to see what it was about. It's a small market, and the owner is Pierre, who I found out was the \"contact\" that Dalia's husband had here in Stardew Valley. Pierre told me that he is a friend of Dalia's husband and that he was the one who found my apartment. He also said that Dalia's husband asked him to offer me a job when I arrived in the village, and that's exactly what he did: he offered me a job as a cleaning lady, with a salary of 1700 gold per month. It's a generous offer, but I can't accept an offer like that without giving it some thought first. I need time to think about the topic for my thesis; that's why I decided to move here. I need to take this into account before making a decision. ^^ Even so, I took a look at his house to see the size and amount of furniture to clean, to help me decide if it would be worth it. While I was there, I met Caroline, his wife, and Abigail, his daughter. Caroline seems nice, but Abigail wasn't very friendly with me. Her manner resembles me when I was still living with my father. I always thought that I was very independent, that I would be free to do whatever I wanted when I lived on my own, and that life would be easy. How immature I was. When I finally moved out of my father's house, reality hit me hard. It was difficult to adapt to the new reality, but I changed and matured. I hope Abigail doesn't have to go through what I went through. Anyway, their house doesn't seem very big, and there's little to clean, so it might be a good opportunity, but I'm still in doubt. I'll think more about this in the coming days. ^^ After going to Pierre's house, I went to the Pelican Town bar, the Stardrop Saloon. That place is quite lively, and I got to know the other villagers. I even met someone really nice there, Sandy. She's very outgoing; I like people like that, even though I'm more on the introverted side. She told me about a festival that was going to take place tonight in the village; it's called \"Night Market\". She said it's an annual festival where traders from various places arrive by boat and set up the docks, selling various items. She invited me to come along, and I accepted. It sounds fun. I was surprised to learn that Pelican Town is on the coast. I love going to the beach occasionally, but I couldn't go often when I lived in the Gotoro Empire. ^^ I found some interesting things for sale during the festival. I wanted to buy some paintings by the painter Lupini, but to my surprise, the sellers didn't accept my money. A saleswoman was even very rude when she saw the money in my hands. I was very confused because no one had ever refused my money until then. I think it's a good idea to go to an exchange office to change my money into the local currency, to avoid this kind of embarrassment once all the hustle and bustle of moving is over. Anyway, I had a great time at the festival with Sandy. I really think we're going to be good friends.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_12": "Winter 22 ^^ I decided to accept Pierre's offer to work as a cleaning lady at his house. His house isn't that big, and Caroline told me that I wouldn't have to go there every day since she could take care of the house herself. She said I only needed to go there on Sundays, which is fine with me. She said I would start next Sunday. ^^ It's good that Caroline can take care of that house by herself. I'll only work four days and earn 1700 gold at the end of the season. That's plenty for me; at least I won't be struggling at the end of the season. ^^ Speaking of money, I talked to Lewis, the mayor of Pelican Town, about where I could find a reliable exchange office in Zuzu City. I want to resolve this before the end of the year; I want to start the new year without any pending issues. This year has been crazy, and I just want peace in the new year. Luckily, Lewis knew one and gave me the address; I plan to go tomorrow. ^^ I've noticed that since I arrived here in Stardew Valley I haven't been bothered by Ricky anymore. No calls, no stalking, no threats... nothing. I think he's finally left me alone. I think moving to Stardew Valley was a wise choice; I should thank Dalia's husband for suggesting this place for me to move to. I'll try to call Dalia before bed. I haven't called her once since the day I got here; she must be worried. And I must also admit that I am curious about what happened to Ricky. Ian said he would pay for the things he did. I wanted to know what happened.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_13": "Winter 23 ^^ Last night, I finally called Dalia, and we talked for hours. She was very worried about me for not calling her once during the week, but she was very happy to hear that I'm okay here in Stardew Valley. I really should have called her earlier, but the move took up a lot of my time, and I kind of forgot to call her. Anyway, it was great to hear her voice. ^^ During the conversation, I asked Dalia what happened to Ricky after I left. She told me that Ricky had been reported by Ian for some crimes he had committed a few years ago. She didn't tell me in much detail; she just said that they were terrible crimes. She also said that he was reported for trying to stalk me even though I had a restraining order. She said that since Ricky had manipulated his friends into watching me, they had also been arrested. However, Ricky ran away, and no one knows where he is. I was shocked to hear all this. Ricky didn't seem like someone who would commit some kind of heinous crime, but it seems that appearances can be deceiving. At least I'm far away from him. He won't be bothering me now. I hope they find him and that he rots in jail for everything he did. ^^ But now, speaking of things here in the valley, today I went to the exchange office that Lewis recommended to me to change the Gotoro Empire money into gold. It was a bit difficult to find the place, as the exchange office had changed its name; but after asking a lot of people, I managed to find it. But when I got there, they didn't exchange Gotoro Empire money for gold. ^^ However, an attendant who also came from Gotoro Empire was very nice to me and gave me the address of a bank that could do the conversion, so I ran there before it closed. Luckily, I arrived in time. It was paperwork after paperwork, but I managed to convert my money. ^^ When I saw how much I had after converting my money to gold, I almost fell over. It was a lot of money, a LOT! I'd always heard that the Gotoro Empire's currency was highly valued, but I didn't know it was that much. Maybe I don't even need that job Pierre gave me after all. But I've already accepted it; I can't quit a job I haven't even started. ^^ Anyway, all this money is a great relief for me. I'll be able to focus on my thesis without worrying about running out of money. I'll be able to concentrate more on my studies and also get to know the people here better. And of course, thinking about the future, I've put some of this money away in the bank to use on some projects I have for after college. I'm not crazy to go out with so much money on me; I don't even have anywhere to keep it. I'm not my dad to keep money under a mattress.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_14": "Spring 15 ^^ Today was a very busy day. It was another festival day: the Desert Festival. There was a festival on Saturday, and there's another one on Monday, and it'll last until Wednesday! It seems like the people of Stardew Valley love a festival. I don't blame them; who doesn't like a day off? I heard about this festival because Sandy was talking about it for days. She really likes this festival; I think it's because she can spend the whole day with Emily. ^^ I went there after I'd finished tidying up my apartment. Doing challenges to win Calico Eggs is very fun, and betting on the races is also very cool; too bad I didn't win once. Maybe I'll try again in the next few days. ^^ But I saw something that caught my interest, something that has nothing to do with the festival. There's an unfinished construction in the desert; it looks like it would be a small building. I asked some people in the village about it, and they told me that it was supposed to be a branch of a company, but the project was canceled because the company went bankrupt, and no one was interested in the place until then. But that place caught my eye. ^^ One of my plans after finishing my studies is to get my own house, but I thought this would be a long-term plan since it would be very expensive. But now that I have a lot of money saved, I can put this plan into practice sooner than expected. I really liked the idea of living in the Calico Desert; it seems very peaceful when there aren't any festivals going on, of course. But I don't mind a bit of noise once in a while. ^^ And since the construction has been abandoned for years and no one is interested in finishing it, maybe I could finish the building and live in it. Maybe it's a crazy idea, but I've really thought about it, and I have the resources to do it, so why not? I love the idea of living in Calico Desert, but of course, I'll do some research to find out who owns the property and see if I can build my house there. That place has a lot of potential. I'd be very happy living in such a peaceful place like the Desert, not to mention that I prefer to live in a place that doesn't snow at the end of the year; I don't like snow very much. I hope everything goes well.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_15": "Spring 26 ^^ I finally made progress in finding the owner of that land where that construction is in the Calico Desert. I've spent the last few days looking for the name of who could be the owner and found one person: Adrian Summers, the son of the owner of the company that went bankrupt. The owner of the land where the company building would be is the son of the company's owner... A very questionable decision, but okay. Anyway, yesterday I got his number, and we arranged to talk at his house in the afternoon. During the conversation, I asked why he left the place abandoned. He said that the place wasn't useful to him because it was poorly located and that he always looked for someone to sell it to, but nobody wanted it. ^^ He was even willing to sell the land to me for a low price, and of course, I said I wanted to buy it; but when he realized I wanted to build a house, he wanted to raise the price. After some bargaining, we reached an agreement, and I bought the land. Now I own that construction; I can finish it and turn it into my house. ^^ I can't believe I'm going to fulfill my dream of owning my own home before I finish college. I think some junimo moved with me to Stardew Valley and is bringing me luck! Leaving the Gotoro Empire was the best move I've ever made. I'll definitely call Dalia to tell her the news and thank her husband for suggesting that I move to the valley. ^^ When I got back, I told Sandy about my plans. She was very happy, but she said that she also had plans for that place. She wanted to set up a store there and was saving money for it. Well, I suggested that we work together to build both my house and the store she wanted. After all, I don't need to live in a building; we could leave the store on the ground floor and my house would be on the first. Sandy loved the idea and agreed to work together to build this building so that we could both make our dreams come true.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_16": "Summer 4 ^^ Over the last few days, Sandy and I have been racking our brains to think of a building design that would please both of us. I want something simpler and less flashy; I'd like to live in a more cozy and discreet place. Sandy, on the other hand, wants a large, modern, and colorful building since, according to her, the more colorful it is, the more attention it will bring to the store. I understand her point, but if I followed her line of thinking, I'd end up living in a dollhouse. ^^ I started to think that suggesting she join me in finishing this building and making our dreams come true might not have been a good idea. We have very different opinions, and it was very difficult to find a middle ground between us. This difference of opinion led us to seek Robin's help to create a design that would please both of us, and she surprisingly succeeded. Her work turned out amazing; Sandy and I love it! ^^ While we were there, Robin asked if we had already thought of a name for the store. We hadn't decided on a name for the store yet, as we were too busy thinking about the building's appearance. But Sandy came up with a name right then: \"Oasis\". I loved the name; I think it makes perfect sense for a store in the middle of a desert to be called Oasis. Now that we have a design we like and the name of the store, the next step is to start constructing the building. I even thought about asking Robin to do the work, but she said she wasn't qualified for such a big job and that it would take her a long time to finish. However, she gave us the contact information of a friend of hers in Zuzu City who could do the job. I called him, and we arranged to meet in person in a few days to sort everything out. ^^ I look forward to seeing this project become a reality. I can't even believe that I'm fulfilling one of my biggest dreams, and I'm very happy to see Sandy's happiness at having her own store, or rather, our own store.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_17": "Summer 9 ^^ Today I met up with the friend Robin had referred to talk about the building's construction. His name is Phillip; he's an engineer. He also brought someone else with him to talk to me, an architect who coincidentally is named Ricky. When I heard his name, I felt a little uncomfortable, but I kept a friendly manner and greeted him. Shaking Ricky's hand felt as if I was handing myself over to the other Ricky, for him to do whatever he wanted with me. It wasn't a very pleasant experience, but I tried to stay calm and focus on what was most important at that moment. Ricky is in the past, and I will not allow him to affect me. Phillip and Ricky said they could help me build the building. ^^ Ricky carefully reviewed Robin's designs and praised the project a lot, but Phillip said that we needed to assess the terrain before moving forward, so the three of us went to the desert to assess the terrain. Ricky was notably surprised to see the abandoned building, and his interest in constructing my building increased. I was curious and asked Phillip the reason for Ricky's reaction. Phillip explained to me that Ricky had worked on the design of the old building, which was his first big project for a major company. Ricky had put a lot of effort into that project, as it would be one of the highlights of his professional career, but unfortunately, the company went bankrupt, the project was never completed, and to make matters worse, the building project was sold to the company, so he wouldn't be able to put that project into practice due to legal issues. ^^ Ricky's history with that building made me trust him to make any changes to the project that Robin had designed, as long as the changes were informed and approved by Sandy and me. He was very happy to know that I was trusting his ability and said that he will do the best job possible, just as he did with the old building project. And Phillip said that the terrain is perfect for the construction of the building and that, if we start as soon as possible, it will be ready in two seasons; much faster than I thought. Now, Phillip and Ricky will take care of the building's planning, and the construction will begin as soon as possible. ^^ I'm very happy that things are going smoothly, despite the ghosts of the past trying to unbalance me. I must take care of these matters before they get out of hand. I learned the cruelest way that unresolved traumas can turn you into someone unrecognizable. I'll never forget the day I saw my mother in a psychotic break and my father had to hospitalize her; it was too much for someone who had just entered adolescence. I looked at my mother and simply didn't recognize her anymore. I don't want to go through that.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_18": "Fall 20 ^^ The construction of the building is finally finished; it was much faster than I imagined. I can't believe I have my own home now, it's a true dream. But before I could finally sleep under the roof of a house I built, I had to go to Zuzu City with Sandy to buy some furniture for the house; I don't even have a bed to sleep on there. So we bought the basics for living in a new house: a bed, a fridge, a stove, and of course, a dishwasher. I've always wanted one in my house. My apartment in the Gotoro Empire had one, and it saved me a lot of time, something I'll definitely need. ^^ Of course, Sandy also made me buy furniture and equipment for the other rooms of the house. She made me buy a sound system to put in the living room and a sofa. I'm glad she reminded me about the sofa; I swear if it weren't for her, I'd have left the store without buying one. Unfortunately, since we live so far away, most of the things I bought will only arrive tomorrow, but it's okay; one night sleeping on an inflatable mattress won't be a problem for me. I've slept in worse places. ^^ After buying the furniture for my house, Sandy and I went to some suppliers to get products to sell in our store. Since the store idea was Sandy's, I let her search for the suppliers. She partnered with some seed and home decoration suppliers, so the store will have a nice variety of products for sale. I can't wait for the opening day.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_19": "Fall 22 ^^ We opened the store today, and practically all the villagers came for the grand opening. Even some people from the city showed up. It was a great day for both of us. Sandy was very happy to see how busy the store was on the first day. I'm sure the store will be a success. ^^ While the store was open, I received a call from an unknown number. I was a bit scared, thinking Ricky had discovered my number again, but I took a deep breath and thought rationally: Ricky hasn't bothered me since the day I moved to the valley, and now that he's on the run, he certainly wouldn't be able to find my new number. If he really wanted to, he would have done it by now. ^^ So I went up to my house and answered the phone. I heard the voice of someone I haven't spoken to in years: my father. I didn't expect to hear his voice after so long, I was very surprised. I asked him how he had found out that I was in Stardew Valley. He told me that he had tried to visit me at my old apartment, but couldn't find me, so he asked Dalia to give him my current number, and that's when he found out that I had moved. ^^ Although I was happy to hear his voice after so long, I didn't understand why he was looking for me. He had distanced himself from me more and more after my mother was institutionalized, to the point where I simply decided to leave. But I understood why he called when he handed the phone to my mother. She finally left the psychiatric clinic and is fully recovered. It was so good to hear her voice; I wish I could be there to give her a hug. ^^ We talked for a long time, and my father said they would come visit me someday. I'm happy that my father has regained his joy in life after having my mother back. He really loves her so much. ^^ I have reasons to be angry with my father. I went through terrible times when my mother was institutionalized, but I'm not angry with him. Because even though he made a lot of mistakes, when I decided to leave, he regretted the things he put me through. At the time, I pretended not to hear and left, but later I realized that he wasn't well enough to take care of me. He was lost, but I was too selfish to notice. ^^ After spending some time talking to my parents, I left Sandy in charge of the store and went to the Saloon to spend some time thinking. While I was there, I saw Willy, the fisherman from Pelican Town. He had just returned from a fishing trip. I heard him talking about a place called Ginger Island, a deserted island that's part of the Fern Islands archipelago. ^^ I'd never heard of this place before, and it piqued my interest; I could study this island and use it as a topic for my thesis, so I went to talk to him about it. He told me that it's a very large and unexplored island; he himself doesn't know exactly what's in the interior of the island since he only stayed on the coast. The only thing he knows is that there's a volcano in the interior of the island, but he doesn't know if it's active or not. ^^ About studying the place for my thesis, he said that it's too dangerous and that he doesn't want to disturb the island's ecosystem. He's right, but the type of research I intend to do won't disturb the island's ecosystem. I'll just write details about the things I find there and use them as research material for my thesis. Of course, I understand his concern; he's not obligated to understand my purposes at first. So I'll try to convince him to take me there, especially since there are three seasons left before my vacation ends, and I want to have a subject for my thesis as soon as possible.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_20": "Fall 25 ^^ I finally managed to convince Willy to take me to Ginger Island. After explaining to him the importance of the thesis and that my research would be purely observational and without interfering with the environment, he agreed to take me. He'll take me there tomorrow and bring me supplies every Sunday. I'm very happy that he agreed to take me there. Now I have to prepare for the trip and take everything I need. ^^ I told Sandy about my trip, and she was surprised. After all, it hasn't even been a week since I moved, and I already have to travel again. Unfortunately, that's how it is for students; it feels like time goes by faster when we're doing something unrelated to our studies. ^^ I also called my parents to tell them about my trip so they wouldn't worry if I didn't answer their calls. They wished me a good trip and said they'll send letters. I'm very happy to have my parents back together; they're both so happy. I wish I could be there to give them a hug. I hope they can visit me at the end of the year.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_21": "Fall 26 ^^ I'm on Ginger Island. This island is really huge, with many places to explore and beautiful landscapes. Besides being a great place for my research, it will be a perfect place to spend the rest of my vacation. I have this whole island to myself; it's a true paradise! But of course, I didn't come here for leisure. I came here to study. Exploring the island's surroundings, I've already found a lot of interesting things. I'm sure my thesis will turn out excellent. ^^ While I was exploring the island looking for something interesting, I saw a small cabin overlooking the sea. It seems like a farm, but it's completely abandoned. It was probably built by a group of people who were shipwrecked here since it's possible to see a stranded ship on the coast. I wonder what happened to those people. ^^ After this little exploration, I gathered some branches to make a fire and set up my tent near the beach to spend the night. This might be one of my best nights to sleep. Everything is so quiet; I only hear the sound of the sea and the crickets. I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_22": "Fall 27 ^^ My first night on Ginger Island was pleasant. It was very relaxing to sleep with the sounds of nature, but for some reason, I felt a strange presence on the island, as if there was someone else here besides me. It must be some kind of anxiety about being totally alone on the island; it should pass in a few days. ^^ Anyway, today I found a kind of slime that's very different from those found elsewhere: orange slimes. They seem to be made of pure magma. I've never seen slimes of that color; it could be a species that only exists on Ginger Island. This island holds many secrets. I'm very excited to be the first person to discover them.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_23": "Winter 4 ^^ I don't think I'm totally alone here. I've been on this island for a few days now and this feeling of being watched hasn't gone away. It's very strange. I'm starting to think there's a reason I feel this way. If it were just a reaction to isolation, it would have passed by now. Maybe this is a sign to be careful. I'll pay more attention to the island's surroundings while I'm exploring.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_24": "Winter 7 ^^ I'm definitely not alone on this island as I thought I was. I swear I saw someone hiding in the bushes this morning while I was studying some plants. I don't know if this person is watching me or if it's just paranoia, but even if it is paranoia, knowing that you're not alone on an island that should theoretically be deserted doesn't give me a sense of security. ^^ Just in case, I've decided that from now on, I'll take shelter in the old cabin I found a few days ago. At least I'll be safe if this person wants to do something. ^^ Coming to Ginger Island was a wonderful idea, but discovering that I'm not alone here is making me rethink things. I might be in real danger here, but I'll be careful and keep an eye on this person's movements.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_25": "Winter 10 ^^ Being on this island knowing that I'm not alone is making me uncomfortable. Even though this person does nothing but stand there watching me from a distance, I'm scared. What if this person is just waiting for the right moment to do something? What if this inertia is just a facade? If a person stalking you and making you feel in constant danger is scary, someone who just watches you without making their intentions clear is even more terrifying. ^^ Despite this, I'm making good progress in my research, which means I'll be leaving this island soon. If this person intends to do anything to me (which I hope they don't), they'd better hurry.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_26": "Winter 13 ^^ Today I decided to take a break from my research and relax a little on the beaches of Ginger Island. I haven't even been in the water since the day I arrived. Plus, I wanted to take advantage of the fact that the person who had been watching me had stopped over the past few days. But that peace didn't last long, because there he was, staring at the ocean. ^^ I could finally see this person more clearly: it was a slightly chubby man dressed in black with shiny details that looked like stars. He also wore a hat with the same details. But there was something about him that was even more eye-catching: the color of his skin was blue, like the sky. I've never seen someone with that skin color; it's so unique. ^^ Of course, as he was nearby, I tried to get his attention. I wanted to know why he was watching me. When he saw me, he tried to run, but I chased after him. I wasn't going to let him escape without giving me an explanation. Looking back now, that idea could have gone very wrong, but I don't know what came over me at the moment. ^^ I followed him until he entered a room inside a large rock. He tried to keep me out by holding the door shut, but I was so determined to get inside that I broke it down. When I entered the room where he was hiding, I was confused by what I found: there was a big screen showing a map of Ginger Island, some computers, and a bed. Apparently, he was living on the island. ^^ He was angry that I broke down the door (rightly so). He said that I shouldn't be there and that I wasn't even supposed to have seen him. I was revolted by what he said. If he didn't want me to see him, why was he watching me? When I questioned him about it, he said that he wasn't watching me, he was just \"living his life\" and that it wasn't his fault if I was always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even though he claimed he wasn't watching me, he knew a lot about me; things he would only know if he knew me, which didn't make sense. After all, how could he know so much about me without observing me? ^^ I questioned him about this, and he told me that knowing many things was one of his powers as \"Mister Qi.\" He said his goal as Mister Qi is to maintain the balance of resources in the world, and knowing many things is a consequence of his powers. ^^ All this talk sounded crazy, and of course I didn't believe it at first. But to prove that he was telling the truth, he did something to me that made me feel a deep connection with him. It was like I could hear him inside my head. But not only that, I could see several things happening around the world at the same time, as if I had been transported into a large room with many cameras where I could see the entire world. I even saw my parents together at home and Ricky in what seemed to be a police chase. ^^ Suddenly, I felt a strong tightening in my chest and a sense of dread. It seemed like I was facing a great danger, and then, in the blink of an eye, I was back in that room looking at that man. That's when I realized that I was facing an extremely powerful being. ^^ All that was new to me. I wasn't expecting to discover that there is a magical being that controls the world and that I was facing one of them. This island hides many surprises. He apologized for almost killing me and asked that I not include anything about the Misters Qi in my thesis. Obviously, I wasn't planning on putting anything about the Misters Qi in the thesis; it would be insane and probably no one would believe it. But he was so worried about it that I had to promise not to write anything. ^^ Of course, I'm not foolish, so we made a deal: in exchange for keeping the secret, he would help me with my research, and he surprisingly agreed. From now on, we're working together. ^^ This guy revealed a lot about the Misters Qi, but he only didn't want to reveal one thing: his name. I tried asking, but he said I should call him Mr. Qi and that his name didn't matter. If he didn't want to reveal his name, I'll call him Azure. He hated the nickname, but I won't call him anything else until he tells me his real name.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_27": "Winter 15 ^^ It seems that everything Azure told me was true. He really does seem to be someone who has lived through a lot in the past. Even though I felt he was telling the truth, I still had doubts, but now I'm certain: he really was telling the truth. ^^ While we were analyzing some slimes, we found those orange-colored slimes that I discovered a few days ago. I asked if he knew anything about them, and of course, he did. He said they're slimes that only exist on Ginger Island. He calls them Tiger Slimes, but they don't have an official name since they haven't been discovered by any scientist. ^^ Knowing this made me surprised and proud. Just imagine a student discovering a new species and writing a thesis about it? It would be an excellent topic! It would bring great recognition to me and the college. Teaming up with Azure was an excellent idea. With his help, my thesis will be the best ever.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_28": "Winter 19 ^^ Willy showed up today to bring the supplies for me, as we had agreed. He also brought a letter from Dalia. She sent a picture from a trip she was taking with her sister and husband. She wrote that she misses me, and I miss her too. We both planned to go on this trip together, but unfortunately, things with Ricky and the move to Stardew Valley didn't allow it to happen. I'm happy she found someone else to go with her. If I had a camera, I'd take some pictures of the island to send back, but unfortunately, I don't. So I just told her that I'm on a paradise island to find inspiration for my thesis. ^^ I was tempted to tell her about Azure, but he said I had to keep his existence a secret. I won't break my promise. I'll only say something if he loosens the terms of this promise, and there's also the fact that he's always watching me, so even if I wanted to, I couldn't talk about him without him finding out. I don't want to get into trouble with someone so powerful. ^^ Speaking of Azure, today he spent the whole day locked in that room. He didn't come out at any time during the day; he only came out after Willy left the island in the late afternoon. Probably because he doesn't want anyone else to see him. Since he had gone out later in the evening and I had already finished my studies for the day, I decided to try talking to him in an attempt to get to know him better. Maybe it would've been better to talk to the rocks; maybe they would respond. ^^ I tried my best to get any information out of him, but he's very reserved. He always says \"You don't need to know,\" \"That's not relevant,\" or just stays silent. The only question he answers differently is about his name. He always says that I should call him \"Mr. Qi\" and that I need to stop calling him Azure. ^^ If it continues like this, it'll be hard to maintain a lasting partnership, but I understand him; he doesn't owe me any explanations. But it would be polite to answer the more important questions so that I could trust him more. But if he wants to stay distant, that's okay.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_29": "Winter 26 ^^ Today was a relatively normal day in my research, which means I had a chance to try to talk to Azure. Actually, talking to him today was easier than it usually is. He was answering most of the questions I asked. To be honest, this change in behavior made me suspicious; he changed so suddenly that something felt off. ^^ I asked him what happened to make him change so much overnight, and he said, without a hint of shame, that he was following the \"advice\" I wrote in my diary a few days ago. He'd been reading my diary with his powers. I was furious; after all, this place is mine alone. ^^ I asked him why he was invading my privacy. He said it was a consequence of seeing everything that happens in the world and that he wasn't actually reading the entries; he was just watching me write them, which is still an invasion of privacy. ^^ He was confused and asked why I was angry if he was \"acting politely,\" as I wanted him to. I had to explain that I wasn't angry at his behavior but at what he did to figure out that I wanted him to act that way. Invading my privacy is a low blow. ^^ Only after explaining this did he seem to understand the mistake he had made. I asked him how long he'd been watching me write diary entries, and he said that he'd been doing it since the day I arrived on the island but that he didn't pay much attention to what I wrote because, in his words, \"There was nothing relevant.\" Despite this, he said he hadn't done it intentionally; he just took into account something I wrote in a single entry. Even so, I made him promise that he wouldn't see me writing diary entries using his powers anymore. He said he can't guarantee it, but he'll try to ignore it. I hope you really will, Azure!",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_30": "Winter 28 ^^ Today is the last day of the year, but even though it's a holiday, Willy still came to the island to bring the supplies I need. Willy is a man of his word; even on the last day of the year, he brought everything. I even asked why he came here during a holiday, and he replied that New Year's Eve isn't a holiday in the Ferngill Republic, so that's why he came. I was surprised to hear that. I thought New Year's Eve was a holiday everywhere, but it seems it's only a tradition in the Gotoro Empire. Anyway, he also brought me some letters. ^^ My parents sent a letter with a postcard of a beach they planned to visit for the New Year's Eve; probably they're both there. Since my mother left the psychiatric clinic, things seem to have gone back to how they used to be. We used to go to the beach on New Year's Eve. It's a shame I can't be there with them. I also received a letter from Sandy about our store's performance so far. The sales have been excellent; most customers are tourists visiting Stardew Valley. I was surprised by the results; we sold far more than I expected. Sandy is an amazing salesperson. ^^ After Willy left, Azure showed up. I decided to spend the New Year's Eve talking to him since he's the only other person on this island besides me. We talked about various things, and I eventually asked him if he had always known he was a Mister Qi or if he discovered it over time. I expected him to say he'd always known, but I was surprised when he said no. He said he only discovered it in his teens. When I heard that, I asked him what his life was like before he found out. ^^ He started talking about his childhood. At that time, he could hear the \"ancestral\" Misters Qi talking to him, but he thought they were just imaginary friends, as they never mentioned he was a Mister Qi. He was an ordinary child, like any other. This surprised me; after all, I never would've imagined he could have had a normal life. It seems so... unreal, considering all his power. I even thought he was lying, but he was being sincere; it was evident in his voice. ^^ He continued to talk about how his \"imaginary friends\" made him feel a little less lonely during his childhood since other kids thought he was strange due to his unusual appearance and behavior. He had few real friends, so he often played with his \"imaginary friends,\" which made him even stranger from an outside perspective. But despite being strange, people always said he was a prodigy because he was much more advanced than other children his age. ^^ Until that point, he was just a relatively normal child, but as he got older, his Mister Qi powers began to strengthen. What started as dreams of being in places he'd never been before evolved into quick flashes of different things happening simultaneously at random times of the day. This terrified him a lot. ^^ When he thought he was going crazy, his \"imaginary friends\" began to reveal themselves. They were the \"previous Misters Qi.\" They explained to him that he was a Mister Qi and his responsibilities, but before he could carry out his mission in the world, he'd have to wait for all his powers to manifest. Azure said his teenage years were very chaotic because of this. ^^ I asked him if there was a significant moment from that time, and he mentioned the day he discovered he could mentally connect with others. He told me how it happened: still in school, a classmate asked him to rewrite a love letter the boy had written, as Azure had the most beautiful handwriting in class. But the boy asked Azure to deliver it to the other boy in the class on his behalf because he was too embarrassed to deliver it in person. ^^ And so he did. During recess, Azure rewrote the letter, and before the next class started, he went to the other boy's desk and handed the letter to him. But as soon as the boy touched the letter Azure was holding, something strange happened. Azure said it felt like a force pulling their minds toward each other. Suddenly, he saw several flashes of scenes from the boy's life: he had access to the boy's memories, fears, and even emotions. ^^ They were so connected that they were able to talk to each other inside the boy's mind. He said he can even remember the conversation they had: ^\"What's going on? How are you here?\" The boy asked, terrified.^\"I don't know! I just wanted to give you the letter Kyle asked me to write. I didn't mean to do this!\" Azure replied.^\"Do you know what we have to do to get out of here?\" Azure shook his head to say no. ^^ The two were at a loss for a few moments until the boy began to suffocate, and then the connection was broken. The boy hadn't been breathing the entire time they were connected. Luckily, the connection only lasted a few seconds. Azure apologized to the boy for what happened. After that, the connections became much more frequent. He didn't even need to touch people; a simple eye contact was enough for him to invade people's minds unintentionally. ^^ The previous Misters Qi had told him this was one of his most important powers, as it allowed him to deeply understand everyone's needs and make wise decisions. He realized how dangerous his powers could be and that he needed to use them cautiously, even if he couldn't control them yet. So he decided to isolate himself to keep everyone safe. ^^ After hearing his whole story, I sat in silence, trying to process everything. He suffered a lot trying to understand his powers and had to distance himself from everyone so that no one would get hurt. I decided to ask him something: \"If you could go back in time and choose to live as a normal person, without powers, would you do it?\" He looked at the ocean for a few moments, got up, and walked away. I think that was his way of saying no, or maybe I had hurt his feelings somehow... I tried to apologize, but he didn't hear me. I returned to the cabin burdened with guilt. ^^ I don't know if it's already the next day or not; I was asleep when I woke up to some knocks on the door. It was Azure. I opened the door for him and asked why he was knocking so late. All he said was \"Yes.\" I was confused, so he told me that if he had the chance to live without his powers, he would. I was surprised; I hadn't expected him to reflect on the question I'd asked. ^^ He added: \"I'm not dissatisfied with the life I have now. My powers have allowed me to discover my purpose in this world, but at the same time, they've prevented me from having certain experiences. Being an ordinary human, I would have had those experiences. Our responsibility is enormous, and our conversation made me realize that it's unfair for it to fall on just one person. Being ordinary seems, in a way, liberating.\" ^^ Hearing that from Azure was surprising. Since the day I met him, he always seemed so confident and unshakeable, but our conversation seems to have brought back a little of his human side. It's even touching to know that deep down, he just wanted to be an ordinary person. ^^ The conversation we had today changed the way I see Azure: he's not a mystical and powerful being; he's a human being who had the misfortune of being called to a mission he never wanted.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_31": "Spring 4 ^^ Today was a very calm day around here. We found some species of crabs in the natural pools of Ginger Island. But while I was observing the crabs, I saw a ship passing in the ocean. I found it very strange; it wasn't Willy's ship, especially since he only shows up on Sunday mornings, and it's Tuesday. It couldn't be him; it was someone else. ^^ I went to where the ship had docked, but found nothing. In fact, I started hearing music as I approached a cave. When I looked inside the cave, I couldn't believe my eyes: pirates. Real pirates. ^^ Before I could do anything, Mr. Qi showed up and told me I shouldn't go in there, that it was too dangerous, and asked me to avoid that place for the rest of the night. He seemed very concerned, so I followed his advice and went back to the cabin. I don't know why he was so worried, but surely there must be a reason.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_32": "Spring 5 ^^ Thanks to Azure's help, my research is progressing really well. I might return to Stardew Valley this season, which is great. Willy came by this morning to deliver a letter from my college, informing me that the enrollment period has begun. I need to fill out a form and mail it on Monday to renew my registration. I've already started working on it and hope everything will be ready tomorrow. ^^ Azure and I had a little adventure today. While we were exploring the northern region of Ginger Island, I noticed the island's volcano has an entrance, as if there's a cave inside. That made me curious; I've never seen a volcano with a cave. ^^ When I asked Azure if we could enter, he said that if we did, we'd need weapons to deal with the monsters and that it was too dangerous for someone with no combat experience, like me. So I asked him to teach me a little so we could enter. He was somewhat reluctant to teach me, saying I wouldn't be able to learn and would end up getting hurt. But I sensed that wasn't his real opinion: he knew I was perfectly capable of learning but didn't want to teach me for some reason. ^\"You think that just because I grew up in the city, I'm not capable of learning how to wield a sword, is that it?\" I said, confronting him. ^ He looked me in the eyes for a moment and then said, \"No. You are capable of learning. Even faster than you think.\" ^\"Then why don't you want to teach me?\" ^\"Because if you get hurt, you'll have to leave.\" ^^ His answer surprised me. Does he... care about me? I thought he was counting down the days until I left, since I'm preventing him from carrying out his responsibilities as Mister Qi. He said I came to the island with a purpose and haven't completed it yet. Until I finish my research, I can't leave. ^^ Anyway, I asked him to teach me how to defend myself from monsters so we could enter the cave. He taught me how to use the sword to defend myself, and we went in. But he wouldn't let me fight any real monsters; he defended me from them whenever I tried to attack. ^^ I know he didn't want me to get hurt, but that didn't work out very well. In one of these attempts to defend me, we were both attacked by a small group of Tiger Slimes and had to leave the cave. Those monsters are really strong! We left the exploration quite injured. If it weren't for Azure trying to defend me all the time, maybe it wouldn't have happened. ^^ When we got back to the cabin, he asked if I was badly hurt. Compared to him, I didn't have a scratch; he took most of the blows from those monsters. I don't even know how he wasn't complaining of pain; it seemed like he didn't even feel it. When I mentioned his injuries, he said they weren't very concerning and would heal in a few days. Still, I bandaged his wounds so they wouldn't get infected. ^^ I also asked him to keep teaching me how to fight monsters and to let me defend myself next time. He agreed to teach me and also said something about me: \"Some people give up learning something new as soon as they realize the difficulties or risks involved, but you still want to learn. That's admirable.\" ^ Now let's see if I learn quickly, because at the pace my research is going, I won't be on this island for long.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_33": "Spring 7 ^^ Yesterday, I finished filling out the form to renew my college enrollment, just as I had planned. Since Willy brings me supplies on Sundays, I asked him to take the form and mail it tomorrow. He said he'd try to send it, but it might be difficult. I asked why, and he said that relations between the Ferngill Republic and the Gotoro Empire have become complicated. Mail shipments to Gotoro might be delayed or, worse, not sent at all. This could really complicate things. ^^ When Willy left the island, I went to Azure's room to ask him to help me with my research. However, he said he couldn't help me today. It was the first time he'd refused to assist me. Since he didn't want to, I continued on my own. ^^ This time, I ventured into a dense jungle area of the island to see if I'd find anything interesting, and as I expected, I did. There are many different species of frogs in that region of the island. My thesis will have a section focused solely on them. ^^ On my way back to the cabin, I ended up encountering a gorilla in the middle of the path. I came face to face with it and froze in fear, not knowing what to do. I had already accepted my fate. But just as I was ready to say goodbye to this world, Azure appeared and managed to scare the gorilla away. I thought he was too busy to help me, but it seems that when he realized I was in danger, he came to save me. ^^ When I thanked him for coming to save me despite all his responsibilities, he said that ensuring my safety was one of them. It seems that he's taking our agreement very seriously. I never asked him to protect me from possible dangers, and yet he does so, apparently of his own free will. I can't believe protecting me is part of his responsibilities.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_34": "Spring 10 ^^ Since my research is at an advanced stage, I decided to take a day off. I spent the day at the beach. At least I'd give Azure a break today. Lately, he's been constantly by my side, helping with the research. Sometimes I wonder if our agreement isn't hindering him in some way. After all, as a Mister Qi, he should be focused on maintaining the world's balance, not helping me. Still, I'm very grateful he takes our agreement seriously. Without him, my research wouldn't be as advanced as it is now. ^^ Although I left him free to fulfill his responsibilities today, he wanted to stay with me and use my day off to continue teaching me how to use the sword. I think it's very thoughtful of him to drop everything just to help me, but he doesn't need to do that all the time; he has more important things to do. I told him I didn't want to train today and that he could go take care of his own business. He understood that I didn't feel like training but still wanted to stay with me at the beach. ^^ I asked if being available to help me all the time wasn't hindering him in some way, and he said it was, but that he could make up for lost time in just one night. He asked if I didn't like having him around, but I told him that wasn't it: I simply didn't want him to abandon his mission because of me. He got a little upset when he heard that and said he wanted to spend more time with me. He added that if I could have a day off, he could too. After that small discussion, we enjoyed our day off together. ^^ Something that made me curious is that, apparently, Azure enjoys my company. He seems to enjoy listening to me or simply being near me. I don't know if it's because of our agreement or if there's something more to it. I tried to look for any sign that he might be interested in me, but I didn't notice anything. Either he hides it very well, or I'm imagining things. ^^ Anyway, we talked a little more while we were at the beach. I asked how he ended up on Ginger Island, and he said he made a deal with a group of pirates to take him to the island in exchange for successful raids. With the help of his powers, he helped them decide who would be the best target and would bring the biggest reward, and in the end, he'd get a cut. He said he's not proud of what he did back then, but it was a necessary evil, since he needed to be on the island to fulfill his mission, and the pirates were the fastest way to get there. ^^ Azure said he and the captain had constant disagreements, but he never suffered any consequences because the crew feared that if they hurt him, they'd all have a streak of bad luck. Azure clearly went through many adventures to reach this island, but one thing wasn't clear to me: how did he meet those pirates? I decided to ask him to understand better. ^^ He explained that when he discovered his role in the world and that he'd have to leave his ordinary life behind to live on Ginger Island, he started living as a nomad in coastal areas. To find shelter, he made deals with certain people, usually fishermen. He'd demonstrate a useful power, and they'd take him in for a while until he moved on again. ^^ Because of this, he became relatively well-known among fishermen and pirates. Many hoped to be lucky enough to meet him on a beach, hoping he'd offer them a deal. And that's how, one day, he ended up meeting the crew of the ship that finally took him to Ginger Island. He had a clever strategy to get to this island. ^^ Azure is used to making deals with people, and that makes me wonder if the way he acts with me is genuine or just part of our deal. He says it's because of our agreement, but he always does things that go beyond it, like chatting with me on a day off. It feels like he sees me as a friend or something like that. But now that I know he's used to making deals, I'm a little suspicious about his true intentions. ^^ Our agreement was that he'd help me with my research in exchange for keeping the existence of the Misters Qi a secret, but I'm starting to think all this help in exchange for keeping a secret is a bit suspicious. What if he's expecting something more? I should question him about it.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_35": "Spring 11 ^^ Because of the conversation I had with Azure yesterday, I began to think that our agreement seemed much more favorable to me than to him. He helps me with my research in exchange for me keeping his existence and powers a secret, but what else does he gain from this? Given his history with deals, I feared he was hiding something. So I decided to confront him about his true intentions once again. ^^ While we were in the cabin gathering the data we collected today, I asked him why he had proposed the deal to me. He said the agreement was the most peaceful way he found to ensure I wouldn't tell anyone about the Misters Qi. I got straight to the point and asked what advantages our deal brought him, and he was equally direct: security. ^^ He asked if I thought he was expecting something more from me, and I said yes. Azure replied, \"It's very arrogant of you to think you have something that would benefit me. You're just a student; nothing you could offer interests me. I just want you to keep my powers a secret, and that's it.\" Hearing him say I'm insignificant to him was pretty harsh, especially given the calm tone he used. It would have been less painful if he'd spoken angrily. ^^ Then I asked why he always wanted to be with me and talk about things unrelated to the research if I had nothing useful to offer him. When I asked that, he really got upset. He said that if I only make friends expecting something in return, my concept of friendship is twisted, and he wasn't like that. Saying that, he made it clear he saw me as a friend, something I wasn't sure about until then. ^^ When I said I just wanted to be sure he saw me as a friend, he said it was obvious, and if that's what I wanted to know, I should've just asked. I admitted he was right, but I didn't fully trust him enough to ask until then. I was afraid I was misinterpreting things. Besides, he never made it clear through his actions: all of them were justified as part of the agreement, and he never left room for other interpretations. ^^ He got upset that I didn't trust him and didn't talk to me again until we finished the research stuff. After that, he left without a word. I made a mistake by not trusting him. I should've asked this sooner. Now I've hurt his feelings. I hope he'll still help me with the research.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_36": "Spring 14 ^^ Today is Sunday, and Willy showed up on the island again, as we agreed. I asked him if he'd managed to mail the form I asked him to send on my behalf last week. He said yes, and that he'd also brought some letters from the Gotoro Empire for me. When I heard that, I thought relations between Gotoro and Ferngill wouldn't affect postal service, but after reading the letters, I discovered that wasn't quite the case. ^^ I found out that from now on, any and all mail from the Gotoro Empire to Ferngill will be inspected and won't be delivered directly to the recipient. It'll have to be picked up at a post office. That's going to complicate things at my college. I'll need to go to Zuzu City whenever new materials arrive. ^^ However, one of the letters was from my college and said that whenever I have materials to pick up, I'll receive a call as soon as they're available. That eased my mind a little. What saddens me is that I won't be receiving any more letters from my parents or Dalia. At least I'll be able to call them when I return to Stardew Valley. ^^ Azure hasn't spoken to me since the discussion we had a few days ago. He won't even help me with the research. I've been trying to apologize, but he won't talk to me. I kind of miss him; it was great having someone to talk to around here. ^^ I tried to go to his room today to apologize again, but the door was locked. He was really hurt that I didn't trust him, and I understand why: he revealed many details of his life to me—things he'd never told anyone—as well as trying to go against his own nature to respect my privacy. I should've realized he trusted me, and I should've trusted him as well. ^^ I was so dumb not to notice right away how much he cares about me. I should've realized that his distant manner was just part of his personality, not indifference. I should've remembered that behind all his power and responsibilities, there's an ordinary human being who, deep down, never asked to be this way. ^^ I hope I get the chance to apologize for being so inflexible before leaving this island. I really miss talking to him, and I wouldn't feel right leaving here knowing we're at odds.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_37": "Spring 17 ^^ Even though Azure stopped helping me with the research, I'm managing to do everything on my own, and I'm almost finished. Thinking about it makes me sad, because it means I won't see him again. ^^ Not being able to talk to him isn't doing me any good. I've been feeling abandoned on this island. I no longer receive letters from my friends and family in the Gotoro Empire; it's been a while since Sandy wrote, and now I don't even have Azure to talk to. I feel like the loneliness is going to drive me crazy. ^^ And to think that before coming here, I didn't see any problem with being alone on this island. But that's because I only knew one kind of loneliness: the physical kind. The loneliness I'm facing now is much worse.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_38": "Spring 21 ^^ I finally received a letter from Sandy after so long. I thought she'd forgotten about me. She apologized for not sending more letters and wrote about the last festival that took place in Pelican Town: the Egg Festival. She said that for the first time, they managed to beat Abigail in the egg hunt. And she was the one who did it! ^^ She mentioned it was a shame I wasn't there to see Abigail's face when Lewis announced the winner of the egg hunt. Along with the letter, Sandy sent a cartoon sketch of Abigail's expression. It looked hilarious; it's really a shame I wasn't there to see it. I wrote a letter back to Sandy and gave it to Willy before he left. I let him know my research is practically finished and that I'll probably return to Stardew Valley next Sunday. My research only progressed so quickly because of Azure's help. I have a lot to thank him for. ^^ Speaking of him, today was the first time I saw him leave his room since that day. He was watching the sea. However, when I tried to talk to him, he ran off, just like he used to before we met. I even considered following him, but I figured it'd be better to give him some space. Maybe he needs more time before he can talk to me again. ^^ Knowing I wouldn't receive any more letters from my friends in the Gotoro Empire, combined with the fact I hadn't received any letters from Sandy until today, was making me feel very lonely on this island. And breaking Azure's trust in me made that feeling even worse. He's the only person I have daily contact with; he's the only one I can count on while I'm here. Our disagreement made me feel like I'd lost the only support network I have around here. ^^ Of course, I have friends in the Gotoro Empire and in Stardew Valley, but I can't count on them while I'm here. That's why, even knowing these people care about me and are willing to help however they can, I still feel lonely without Azure by my side. ^^ I hope we can reconcile before I leave the island. However, I believe forcing things isn't the best option: he needs to be willing to forgive me. So I'll give him some space, even though all I want to do is go into that room, give him a hug, and ask for forgiveness.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_39": "Spring 23 ^^ My research is finally done. Now I just have to wait for Willy to come on Sunday so I can leave this island. I'm thrilled it ended so quickly, but I feel like I'm not as happy as I should be. This is my future we're talking about, yet I can't seem to grasp its importance. I think my mind is focused on something else. ^^ This \"something else\" is powerful and has blue skin. He's begun watching me from afar again, just like he did before we met. This morning, while having breakfast, I noticed him standing among some palm trees, observing me. As soon as I noticed, I tried to approach him slowly, but with each step, he moved farther and farther away until he ran off. I wish he wouldn't do that, but just not being locked in that room all day is already such progress. ^^ When I first arrived on this island and realized I was being watched, I felt like prey trying to hide from a predator in its den: no matter how well I tried to hide, I'd be caught at any moment. The sense of danger was constant, and the impossibility of escape made everything worse. But when I decided to face this \"predator\" and get to know him better, I realized he's not a threat to me. ^^ Yes, I know Azure still watches me, but the feeling isn't the same as before. I no longer feel in danger when he observes me, and in a way, I even like it: I feel... strangely comfortable with it. Even though he doesn't talk to me or run away when I notice him, I feel like he's by my side when he does it, and that makes me feel good. ^^ I know it's strange to feel this way about it, especially considering what I went through with Ricky, but what I went through with him isn't the same as what I'm going through with Azure. With Ricky, being watched was a reason to be on alert all the time: he could be anywhere, waiting to do something to me. With Azure, being watched is like having a guardian angel: he stays distant and hidden, only appearing when needed. Being watched by Azure brings me peace, and he's the only person who can make me feel this way. I wouldn't feel like this being watched by anyone else. ^^ However, even though knowing he's watching me brings me comfort, it's not enough: I want him by my side, physically. I want to speak with him face-to-face and ask for forgiveness for not trusting him. Actually, I don't think that's the only reason I want to talk to him. I've stopped talking to many people for similar reasons and never felt this desire to mend things as I do with Azure. I only felt something like this when I fell in love. I think that's what happened: I fell in love with Azure. ^^ I can't believe this happened. How could I fall in love with someone like Azure? He can't leave this island, and no one can know he exists. How would I explain to Willy why I'm visiting the island if I want to see Azure? Will I have to abandon the life I've just built to be by his side? There are so many questions, and the only way to answer them is to talk to Azure. I need to do that, even if he doesn't want to talk to me.",
	"Mona-s_Diary.Entry_40": "Spring 27 ^^ Tomorrow I'm leaving this island, and until now, I hadn't managed to talk to Azure: every time I thought about going to his room, something made me stop halfway. But today, I decided I'd talk to him, no matter what. If I didn't say it now, I'd never get another chance. ^^ In fact, before I even had the chance to go to Azure's room, there he was, standing in front of the cabin door. Seeing him so close—after so long only seeing him watch me from afar—made me so happy I was speechless; the only thing I could do was give him a tight hug. ^^ He didn't react for a few seconds, but then he hugged me back. It was the first time I had such intimate contact with him. I confess I wanted to hug him for longer, but the few seconds we were hugging felt like hours. When I finally let go, I said I didn't expect him to show up at my door after what happened and that I thought he wouldn't want to see me anymore. Azure said he hadn't liked knowing I didn't trust him, but that he understood why and wanted to forgive me; that's why he showed up at the door. ^^ Knowing he understood my reasons for distrusting him and was willing to forgive me gave me the courage to start talking about how I feel about him. I started by saying how awful I felt for not having him around these past few days. Azure replied that he'd also been feeling strange, which is why he went back to watching me from afar: he missed being with me. Of course, he didn't say it exactly like that, but his choice of words made it clear. ^^ Realizing we were going through the same thing but reacting differently, I tried to find a way to say I'd fallen in love with him without being too direct, just like he does. After thinking for a moment, I said, \"You know, this time we've spent apart made me realize something... that you're very important to me. I can't think of anything else but what I'm going to do without you when I return to Stardew Valley. I don't know if you understand what I'm feeling, but I...\" ^ Then he interrupted me and finished my sentence, \"... I love you. That's what you wanted to say, isn't it?\" ^ \"Yes, it was...\" I answered, a bit awkwardly. ^ I asked if he felt the same way about me, and he said he was still unsure if it was really love, but now he was sure it was. I asked if he wanted to date me, and he accepted. ^^ Although I was very happy, the same questions I had asked myself came back to my mind: How will our relationship work? How will I meet him without anyone knowing about his existence? I didn't waste time and asked Azure these questions, and he said I don't need to worry; he'll figure it all out. He didn't make it very clear how he would do it, but I trust he'll solve this problem. ^^ Since he told me not to worry, I decided to enjoy the rest of my last day with him. We spent some time at the beach, and at the end of the day, he helped me pack the rest of my bags. Now I feel truly ready to leave this island; reconciling with Azure was the last thing I needed to do here. I don't know how our relationship will be from now on, but I'm willing to face whatever it takes to stay with Azure.",

She saw this trip as a great opportunity to come up with a topic for her thesis, which she would start producing as soon as her vacation was over.",

After all, she had already seen what she shouldn't have.#$b#She was supposed to keep it a secret, so we made a deal: she would keep the secret if I helped her with the research, and to keep the secret, I had to accept.",
	"Event-06.MrQiRealNPC.AHiddenPain.11": "We'd meet up several times during the day. She'd tell me about her new discoveries, and I'd help her unravel the mysteries of the island.#$b#Despite the challenge, it was a fair exchange, and our relationship grew stronger.",

I had fallen in love with Mona, but I just ignored this feeling.#$b#I had to concentrate on my mission as Mister Qi; that was why I had moved to Ginger Island. I couldn't let a simple chemical reaction in my brain distract me from my goal.#$b#At that point, I couldn't ignore that feeling anymore. The more I tried to repress it, the worse it would get.#$b#So I decided to tell Mona how I felt, so that I could get rid of that weight. If Mona left and I didn't tell her how I felt about her, I would feel very bad.#$b#What I didn't expect was for the feeling to be reciprocated.

But as soon as she passed away, I began to isolate myself again.$s#$b#The only person I still kept in touch with was Sandy; she was Mona's friend and managed the Oasis when she couldn't. She started to manage the Oasis full time after Mona passed away.$s#$b#Several times, I thought about going back to Ginger Island. It was very difficult being in the same room where Mona slept; I remembered her no matter where I looked.$s#$b#And at night, it was even worse... I couldn't even turn to the bedside where she slept.$s#$b#I only had a little peace when I took everything that reminded me of Mona out of my sight. At least that way, I could sleep.",
