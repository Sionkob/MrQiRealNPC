# Mister Qi is a Real NPC
[Mister Qi is a Real NPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16724) is a Content patcher mod that turns Mister Qi into a giftable NPC by adding him as a custom NPC. The mod brings a new history to the character while respecting Mister Qi's original personality.

# Requirements
Currently, this mod only needs one mod to work:
- [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) - By Pathoschild

# Installing instructions
To install the mod, just copy it to your game's Mods folder. To uninstall it, just remove the **[CP] Mister Qi is a Real NPC** folder from your Mods folder.

# What is currently working?
The mod is under development and some things are not completed yet, but some things are already working, for example:
- Mr. Qi is recognized as a giftable NPC by the game.
- There are new dialogues up to 8 hearts.
- There are 12 events ready, 9 of them are heart events.
- 2 new maps have been added.
- Mr. Qi appears at every vanilla festival when you meet him.
- The schedules have been modified (but still incomplete).
- New dialogues for Mr. Qi who stays inside the Walnut Room have been added.
- Sandy talks about Mr. Qi and the casino when you become a club member.
- Now the mod is fully compatible with Stardew Valley 1.6.

As the mod is updated, more functions will be added, removed, or modified.

Currently, I'm working on the beta version of the mod. At the moment, this version adds:
- Unlocks Mr. Qi as a romance option (see more details below)
- Adds more heart events for Mr. Qi (see more details below)
- Adds 10 hearts dialogue if Mr. Qi is not a romance option
- Adds dialogue lines up to 6 hearts if Mr. Qi is a romance option
- Adds the possibility of inviting Mr. Qi to see a movie if he is a romance option

Currently, it's not possible to install the beta version, but it will be available soon.

# What does not work/is not 100% ready?
Currently there are a few things that are not complete yet, I will finish them as soon as possible:
- The schedules are incomplete
- The dialogue lines of 8 and 10 hearts when Mr. Qi becomes a romance option are missing
- Some of Mr. Qi's heart events when he becomes a romance option are missing
- Mr. Qi's marriage dialogues are missing
- Mr. Qi's patio and spouse room are missing
- Mr. Qi's schedules when he becomes a romance option are missing

In my testing, there's nothing that isn't working, there are just some incomplete features that will be completed as updates roll out. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, feel free to comment on the Nexus Mods [posts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16724?tab=posts) page.

# More Details
Here are some details about what is currently added, some things may change in the course of updates.

## Mod Settings
This mod brings a setting, which can be changed when you open the game for the first time after installing the mod:

#### Kid or Name
This setting allows you to change the way Mr. Qi will refer to you in some dialogues, he may refer to you as "Kid" or your farmer's name. By default, it uses your farmer's name.

## New Maps
This mod adds 2 new maps to the game: Mr. Qi's room and a small laboratory.

### Mr. Qi's room map:
> ![QiRoom](https://github.com/Sionkob/MrQiRealNPC/assets/135146475/50b72d08-9915-4ff7-8b88-aad040267e2e)

Mr. Qi's room can be accessed through a corridor in the Casino.

### Lab map:
> ![QiLab](https://github.com/Sionkob/MrQiRealNPC/assets/135146475/893a2c2e-0f97-4b30-981c-9545d42ee1da)

The entrance to Mr. Qi's laboratory is at the door in the center of the small hallway in his room. The laboratory can only be accessed when the player has 6 hearts or more with Mr. Qi. If the player doesn't have enough hearts, the entrance to Mr. Qi's laboratory will be closed with an invisible wall that prevents the player from passing through.

## Events
Currently there are 11 events added, 8 of them are heart events, more events will be added over time. These are the preconditions to trigger each event:

#### Event #1
Enter the Casino after obtaining the [Club Card](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Club_Card).

#### Event #2

The farmer is called by Mr. Qi, who reveals that he is a manifestation of a consciousness passed down through the ages. He explains that there have been other Misters Qi before him and that their mission is ensure the balance of resources in the world. Mr. Qi reveals that he has semi-physical, spiritual and extra-physical representations, each one is controlled by him and has specific functions, which help him fulfill his mission. The farmer is introduced to some of these representations, and at the end, Mr. Qi expresses relief that he no longer needs to hide the truth. 

In response to the revelation, the farmer can react in two ways:

**I'm kind of... I'm scared of you.** *(-5 friendship)*

The farmer expresses fear towards Mr. Qi. Mr. Qi explains that he observes everyone with good intentions and uses this to get to know the needs of people in Stardew Valley. Despite the farmer's fear, Mr. Qi assures that he's there to help.

**You can be in several places at once, you can control the world around you, you're not the first Mister Qi and now you observe and create challenges for me. It's so much to process...** *(No effect on friendship)*

The farmer expresses difficulty in processing all the information revealed about Mr. Qi. Mr. Qi recognizes the complexity of the topic and admits that it may have been a mistake to reveal everything at once. He emphasizes that the intention was never to scare the player, but to share the truth.

Regardless of the choice, Mr. Qi explains his interest in the farmer, revealing a promise made to the farmer's grandfather to guide and motivate the farmer's journey in Stardew Valley. And he encourages the farmer to continue exploring the valley to reach the perfection.

#### Event #7
This event has different prerequisites and endings depending on the choice you made in the previous event:

If you chose option 2 in Mr. Qi's 8 hearts event (**You can be in several places at once, you can control the world around you, you're not the first Mister Qi and now you observe and create challenges for me. It's so much to process...**), Having 10 hearts with him, go to [Pelican Town](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pelican_Town) on the Winter 28 between 11PM and 2AM.

If you chose option 2 in Mr. Qi's 8 hearts event (**I'm kind of... I'm scared of you.**), Having 10 hearts with him, talk to Mr. Qi on Winter 26. He will ask you the following:

> Hey [Player name],  the day I told you the truth about me, you said you were scared of me... So I wanted to ask you something... Are you still afraid of me?

You can answer in two ways:

**Yes, I'm still afraid of you.** *(No effect on friendship)*

**No, I'm no longer afraid of you.** *(No effect on friendship)*

After answering this question, still with 10 hearts, go to [Pelican Town](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pelican_Town) on the Winter 28 between 11PM and 2AM.

The farmer meets Mr. Qi in the Pelican Town cemetery in front of Mona's grave, where the player and Mr. Qi talk. The conversation continues until Mr. Qi decides to go to the bridge.

If you chose option 2 in Mr. Qi's 8 hearts event, or chose the option "**No, I'm no longer afraid of you.**" in the question Mr. Qi asks on Winter 26, Mr. Qi reveals that he feels something more for the farmer, and asks if the farmer feels the same way. You can answer in 2 ways, and the event will end differently depending on your choice:

**Yes, I feel the same way about you, I think I would have a relationship with you.**

If you choose this option, Mr. Qi will be happy, but he admits that he is afraid to continue because of what happened to him before, but the farmer undertakes to help Mr. Qi get over what happened. The friendship with Mr. Qi will return to 2 hearts and, the next day, he will be a romance option.

**No, let's just stay friends.**

If you choose this option, Mr. Qi will understand your choice and thank you for being there for him. The romance option is not unlocked and there is no friendship loss.

If you chose option 1 in Mr. Qi's 8 hearts event, or chose the option "**Yes, I'm still afraid of you.**" in the question Mr. Qi asks on Winter 26, Mr. Qi understands that the farmer is afraid of him, but that he has no hard feelings and is grateful that the farmer listened to his story.

# Translations
Currently, this mod cannot receive translations because it's not available for download, but if you are a translator and are interested translating it into your language as soon as the beta version is available to everyone, you can download a copy of the **default.json** file to your computer and translate it, but remember that the mod is undergoing constant changes and the i18n file may undergo major changes.

# Known Errors
<details>
	<summary>Bug fixed in update 0.4.0-alpha.1, released on October 16, 2023.</summary>

When opening the game for the first time (or at the beginning of each day), if you open the SMAPI console, you will encounter an error similar to this:

 `[ERROR game] Failed parsing schedule for NPC Mister Qi:
0 QiNutRoom 5 2 1/1920 QiNutRoom 7 4 0 mrqi_staring/2400 QiNutRoom 5 2 1
ArgumentException: In warpCharacter, the character's currentLocation must not be null
   at StardewValley.Game1.warpCharacter(NPC character, GameLocation targetLocation, Vector2 position)
   at StardewValley.NPC.parseMasterSchedule_Patch1(NPC this, String rawData)`
  
This error happens because there are 2 "Mister Qi" in the game, each with a different internal name. One of them has the internal name set to "Mister Qi". This Mister Qi cannot be turned into a giftable NPC (i.e. it's not possible to befriend him), but apparently he can have a schedule, even if the SMAPI console returns an error. In my tests even with this error, the schedule works normally, this error can be ignored, at least for now. I still don't know how to fix this error, but I'm studying ways to solve it as soon as possible.

Actually, there's no known errors in this mod. If you find any bugs, please report on Nexus Mods [bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16724?tab=bugs) page.
